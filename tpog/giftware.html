<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Goals"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">Goals</A></H1>
<P>My goal is to create a good, usable, working model of intellectual
property. A working model would not only explain historical decisions
up to the present, but it would also serve as a basis for future
decisions, regardless of technological development. The historically
recent addition of computer technology has caused some people to
reinterpret intellectual property laws in new ways. A good model
would remain valid regardless of what new technology advance occurs.
A good model would actually allow people to properly apply
intellectual property laws as new technology begins, rather than
having to look back in hindsight to understand and correct what
happened.</P>
<P>The first goal of this document is to present such a model. A
secondary outcome of creating this model is that it will allow the
reader to view the current mass of intellectual property laws in a
new light, and possibly cause changes in those laws. A good model
would allow citizens to evaluate their government's current body of
intellectual property laws. And if those laws are found to be
misaligned, the model should provide citizens with clear and
objective changes to bring the law into alignment.</P>
<P>But the final and primary goal of this document is to present a
usable model for the benefit of Open Source projects. 
</P>
<P>The current Open Source phenomenon can be traced by to 1984 when
Richard M. Stallman posted the source code for his text editor,
Emacs, on the internet. Mr. Stallman created a work in the form of a
software program, and he allowed anyone to download his work for free
(He also sold tape copies for $150). As time went on, more people
followed this idea, adding their works to those freely available on
the internet. A snowball effect occurred, and this phenomenon has
produced whole operating systems and applications, massive amounts of
code, all freely available on the internet. 
</P>
<P>But the Open Source movement remains an ethereal success. There
are few models for this inexplicable phenomenon. The current body of
Open Source leaders cite various reasons for their success. The Free
Software Foundation claims it's about Freedom. The Open Source
Initiative claims it's about Openness. Eric S. Raymond wrote an
article called &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; that claimed
it's about Development Style (Bazaar style versus Cathedral style).
Mr. Raymond also wrote another article called &quot;Homesteading the
Noosphere&quot; whose title claimed that it's about getting a good
reputation for good code.</P>
<P>However, when newcomers attempt to appy these models of Open
Source to their project, some of them fail miserably. A good model, a
good working theory, a good understanding would allow new leaders to
apply the model to new areas and guarantee relative success in that
endeavor. It would also allow people to recognize when the Open
Source model is not suited for their project, so they can avoid using
the wrong tool for the job at hand. 
</P>
<P>The primary goal of this document is to understand what's at the
heart of a successful Open Source project. The goal is to understand
and model this success so that it can be given away to new projects
and new leaders. Like giving away the source code to a program, this
document intends to give the source of the Open Source projects to
the world so that everyone can freely use it.</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="The Gift"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">The Gift</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>I recently
started reading &quot;The Gift - Imagination and the Erotic Life of
Property&quot; by Lewis Hyde. The author wrote the book to explore
how he, a writer in various arts and fields, could create a work of
art, a gift of himself to the world, and still pay the bills in a
world of commodity exchange. People in the Open Source community will
recognize this as a nagging question that will not go away. &quot;The
Gift&quot; starts out by looking at gift exchange as a phenomenon all
to itself and attempts to define what it is (and what it is not). As
I read the book, I kept thinking &quot;<I>This is the heart, the
essence, that drives Open Source.</I>&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>I highly
recommend that anyone contemplating being active in an Open Source
project, especially someone who intends to become a leader in the
arena, to read this book.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Eric S. Raymond mentions &quot;Gift Exchange&quot; in
&quot;Homesteading the Noosphere&quot; as being a part of the Open
Source movement, but he looks at it as secondary in power to the
drive behind getting a good reputation. As I read &quot;The Gift <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>-
Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property</FONT></SPAN>&quot;, I
started to see the power of a &quot;Gift Exchange Community&quot; and
how it differed greatly from a &quot;Commodity Exchange&quot;
transaction. Mr Raymond mentions some of the abuses that occur in a
Gift Exchange, but as I read &quot;The Gift <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>-
Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property</FONT></SPAN>&quot;, I
could see that elements of a pure Gift Exchange had been part of the
spark for a number of successful Open Source projects in the past. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>I believe it
is the concept of Gift Exchange applied to software, hardware, and
documentation that must be at the heart of a successful Open Source
project. I created the term &quot;Giftware&quot; to capture this
concept.</FONT></P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="The Definitions"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">The
Definitions</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>To define a &quot;Gift Exchange&quot;, it becomes
clearer when the term is contrasted by its opposite, the &quot;Commodity
Exchange&quot;. Here are the definitions of both.</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="#Part 1">Commodity Exchange</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>A true commodity exchange is a trade between two
people. I go into a store and exchange money for a book, or money for
food, or money for clothing, or money for shelter. Money does not
have to be involved in a commodity exchange. Jack trades with another
man, the family cow for a handful of magic beans. A street vendor
might offer to exchange old lamps for new. But the quality of a
commodity exchange is &quot;this for that&quot;. In a commodity
exchange, the two people exchange goods, and that is the end of the
transaction.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In commodity exchange, you could visualize a scale that
measures &quot;this&quot; on one side and &quot;that&quot; on the
other. A commodity exchange would have these balance at the end of
the transaction. Now, the real world has &quot;Buyer's Markets&quot;
and &quot;Seller's Markets&quot; where the scale tips to one side or
the other, but these are still expressions of the Commodity Exchange
model. The ideal situation has the scale balance. A Commodity
Exchange is simply an expression of the conservation of energy
applied to economic transactions. Energy isn't created or destroyed,
it simply changes hands. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The internal motivations of the individuals are
irrelevant to the transaction as a whole. A seller may be motivated
by profit, greed, honor, craftmanship, or the motivation that their
product will cure cancer. A buyer may be motivated by want, need,
desire, scarcity, Hunger Pangs, or the motivation that their purchase
helps support cancer research. A buyer and seller may trade objects
which they deem worthless for something they deem invaluable. The
individual drive is to enter a Commodity Exchange for personal gain,
in whatever subjective measure that is for the individual.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Rather than focus on the subjective measures of the
individual, the model of Commodity Exchange focuses on the total
transaction as measured in the objective scale of a Free Market. A
Free Market is one that has many buyers and sellers, and competition
for both is relatively balanced. In the space of a Free Market,
sellers will tend to sell their products with just enough profit
margin to make it worth their while. Buyers will tend towards
purchasing the product that balances their personal preferences
between quality and price. The objective measure becomes money. The
internal motivations of the actors becomes irrelevant. That Buyer Bob
gave what he subjectively considered a pittance of money for
something he considered invaluable is irrelevant to the objective
fact that Bob paid $5 for a bottle of Aspirin to stop his migrane
headache.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Bob exchanges $5 which approximates the value of the
bottle of Aspirin in a Free Market. In this measure, energy is
conserved.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The one sentence definition is:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">Commodity Exchange: Two
people trading goods of approximately equal value (value being
measured in the objective currency of a Free Market), such that the
transfer balances at the end of the transaction. 
</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Gift Exchange"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">Gift
Exchange</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>A true Gift Exchange is quite unlike a Commodity
Exchange in several ways. Let's start with a definition: 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Gift Exchange: a transaction between two people where
one person (giver) gives the second person (receiver) some gift (of
value), and the transaction ends with this unbalanced transfer of
goods. The reciever does not reciprocate anything to the giver. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The term Gift Exchange can be confusing. &quot;Exchange&quot;
can denote &quot;a give and take&quot;, but a gift is strictly one
way, from giver to reciever. A better way to think of &quot;exchange&quot;
is to think of a &quot;place where gifts can be given&quot;. This
fits in line with meaning of &quot;exchange&quot; where a &quot;Stock
Exchange&quot; is a place where people buy, sell, and trade stocks. A
Gift Exchange, therefore, does not mean two people agreeing to buy
each other a $20 dollar gift to exchange on Christmas. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>A Gift is something given with no expectation of
reciprocation, and a Gift Exchange is the &quot;field&quot; in which
gifts are given and received.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>This definition might lead one to believe that energy
is not being conserved, and therefore there is no such thing as a
true Gift Exchange. Or, if there is a Gift Exchange, it is not
something that can support itself over a long period of time. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>A Commodity Exchange balances within the transaction.
Two people exchange goods, and a balance is maintained at the
transaction level. A Gift Exchange can conserve energy too. But you
have to look at the entire Gift Exchange community, over a period of
time, to see the transactions balance. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>For example, a barn-raising is a gift that a community
can give to an individual farmer. The gift transaction benefits only
the individual farmer. The single transaction leaves the balance of
energy quite lopsided. But over time, you may see that farmer working
as part of another barn-raising for someone else's benefit. It isn't
required that the goods traded be the same, like a barn-raising for a
barn-raising. People might pitch in to help someone who is too sick
to harvest their crops. But a working Gift Exchange conserves energy
within its community and doesn't require magical thinking to explain
its existence.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The internal motivations of the giver and reciever is
irrelevant to the gift being given with respect to the Gift Exchange
field. The giver may be motivated to give the gift out of compassion,
malice, charity, spite, or the motivation that the gift may feed a
hungry person. The reciever may have the internal drive to demand the
gift, accept the gift graciously, turn their nose up at the gift, or
ask for more gifts. The objective measure of a gift is that the Giver
gives the gift freely, without any requirement to do so, and the
reciever recieves the gift free and clear, without any requirement to
reciprocate in any way. The &quot;energy&quot; of the gift is the
value of the gift as measured on the Free Market.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The following diagrams show a Commdity Exchange, a Gift
Exchange, and a simple Gift Exchange Community. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="exchanges.png" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=767 HEIGHT=1004 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>So, a Commodity Exchange and a Gift Exchange both
conserve energy. One balances in the transaction, and one balances
within the community over time. 
</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="The Exchanges in Application"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">The
Exchanges in Application</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>A Gift Exchange is not -BETTER- than a Commodity
Exchange. They are both valid models because they both conserve
energy. It's simply a matter of figuring out where to apply the
models in real life.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The Commodity Exchange makes sense when strangers wish
to conduct business and it is unlikely that they'll ever see each
other again. The Gift Exchange takes time to balance out, and until
that happens, energy will be lost, companies will go out of business,
and people will go hungry. Over an infinite amount of time, the Gift
Exchange will balance out, but mortgage payments are due on a monthly
cycle. So there are times and places where you may choose one
exchange over the other based on your commitments and your current
situation. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>A Gift Exchange makes sense where energy can balance
out within a reasonable amount of time. A Gift Exchange also requires
a community through which the individual transactions can flow. It
also requires that the person starting the Gift Exchange is
completely willing to give their gift away. While a Commodity
Exchange is a model of energy stasis or balance, a Gift Exchange is a
model of Momentum introduced into the community by an individual. The
individual must be willing to completely surrender their gift to the
community to allow the community to take that energy, transform it
into something else, and pass that new gift along. For a Gift
Exchange community to sustain itself, the momentum must be allowed to
pass through the community unhindered. The gift may change forms from
one person to the next, but the Momentum is maintained and possibly
increased. 
</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="The Power of Gift Exchange"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">The
Power of Gift Exchange</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>So, what is it about a Gift Exchange that will drive an
Open Source project to success? It was so simple, that I didn't see
it until I read &quot;The Gift&quot;. It is so simple, that at first
glance, some might disregard the power and effect that this wields. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>A Gift Exchange builds community.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>A buyer or
seller will trade goods in a commodity exchange for whatever internal
reason they have. Perhaps they're hungry and wish to buy some food.
Perhaps they are a farmer and wish to sell the excess food that they
grew. Perhaps they asked some outrageous price just to see if anyone
would take it. Whatever the reasoning, the drive behind a buyer and
seller is purely personal.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The giver
gives a gift for whatever internal reason, whatever internal drive,
they have. Perhaps they're feeling generous. Or perhaps they're
feeling like a good intellectual challenge. Or perhaps they're
feeling like they can write something better than anyone has ever
written. Whatever the reasoning, the drive behind giving a gift is
completely personal. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>A Commodity
Exchange ends with the transaction with all drives and effects
remaining internal. A Gift Exchange may have its personal drives and
effects, but it also has community building effect that operates
outside the transaction and ties the individual giver with the entire
community.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Once an
individual gives a gift, momentum is created that can ripple through
the entire community. One gift can spark an entire movement of gift
giving. A gift that stays in motion through the community can
strengthen that community and benefit it as a whole. The active
members of a Gift Exchange community contribute to something that
goes beyond their personal borders. This individual drive to
contribute can bring together the combined energies of whole
communities.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>From a physics
point of view, energy is conserved in both models. But from a human
point of view, the ability to build communities can make a Gift
Exchange more powerful than the individual transactions of a
Commodity Exchange.</FONT></P>

During their picnic, they discovered an ungainly looking wrench of
the size one might expect to need when fixing a steam shovel. It was
a completely useless object to either family. However they took it
home with them, and it became a perpetual gift between the two
families. Whoever had the wrench in their possession would find some
way to secretly give it to the other family. Someone might go out to
their umbrella stand to find their umbrellas in the company of the
steam shovel wrench. They, in turn, might take the wrench and
secretly deposit it in the other family's home hidden among more
useful tools.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>This
exemplifies the power of a Gift Exchange. The actual gift, the
wrench, had no market value. But it served as the token of a pure
gift. The families gave the wrench back and forth between themselves
as a series of gift transactions. The wrench was not exchanged for a
screwdriver. But the giving of an even worthless gift had the effect
of reinforcing the connection, the relationship, the community
between these two families. </FONT>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="NOT a Gift Exchange"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">NOT
a Gift Exchange</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>It is probably worth mentioning what a Gift Exchange is
NOT. Obviously, a Commodity Exchange is not a Gift Exchange. But more
subtle, more slippery, and more sinister, are transactions in which a
person claims they are a giving a gift, but, in actuality, it is not
a pure Gift Exchange.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Reciever requirements: For the transaction to be a true
Gift Exchange, the reciever cannot have an expectation to receive the
gift. The reciever cannot use guilt, shame, humiliation, etc to
receive the gift. The gift must be given freely without a sense of
obligation, and the gift must be received freely without a sense of
indebtedness.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Giver requirements: A true Gift Exchange prohibits the
giver from giving the gift as a means to dominate the receiver or to
leave the reciever with a sense of indebtedness. A true gift can NOT
be given to humiliate or to establish or reinforce hierarchies.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>While these reflect the subjective, internal, drives of
the giver and reciever, they can exhibit objective measures in the
Gift Exchange. If a gift is given with restrictions or qualifications
or any other similar limitations, then those limitations reflect the
degree to which it is NOT a gift. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>When Eric S. Raymond mentions Gift Exchanges in
&quot;Homesteading the Noosphere&quot;, he quickly goes into gifts
given to establish a good reputation in a particular software area,
i.e. Gifts given to homestead a spot in the Noosphere. This can
quickly turn into a Gift Exchange &quot;gone bad&quot;, something
given to establish personal fame and possibly even to stake a
monopolistic claim to that area of fame. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>When the gift is given as a means to exert control or
influence on the reciever (or the community as a whole), or when it
is given out of a feeling of obligation, then all community-building
benefits that come with a Gift Exchange are destroyed. Such a
transaction should not be considered a Gift Exchange.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>While a Gift Exchange can be defined in terms of energy
balancing within a community over time, when trying to decide if a
transaction fits in a Gift Exchange or not, a good rule of thumb is
to ask whether community is being strengthened or not. If the answer
is no, then it is not a Gift Exchange.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>When someone gives a gift, and no community is
strengthened, then it is not a Gift Exchange.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>A Gift Exchange and a Commodity Exchange both conserve
energy. The only advantage that separates a Gift Exchange from a
Commodity Exchange is the power that a Gift Exchange has to build,
strengthen, and grow a Community. If the Community is not benefitting
from the exchange, then it is likely NOT a Gift Exchange that is
occuring.</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Gift Exchange and Open Source"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">Gift
Exchange and Open Source</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The Gift
Exchange and Commodity Exchange are two ideal models. Obviously, the
real world does not fall neatly into ideal models. But when Open
Source is mapped into the Gift Exchange model, the requirements of a
successful Open Source project begin to surface. At the heart of any
successful Open Source project is a Gift Exchange community. A
programmer writes some code, and gives that code to the world. A
single gift transaction sparks entire communities.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The
development style is important, but it does not indicate whether a
project will be a successful Open Source project. It could be a
Cathedral or a Bazaar. It could be the small, powerful team style as
described in &quot;The Mythical Manmonth&quot; by Frederick Brooks.
Open Source projects have successfully used the development style of
a Benevolent Dictator, an Oligarcy, and a True Democracy where every
contributer votes. Some have even had multiple leaders who take turns
on a rotating basis (an approach used by the ancient Greek army when
they defeated the army of the Persian Empire in the Battle of
Marathon.) Each project can design or evolve its development style as
it needs to do so, with the advantages and disadvantages that comes
with each style.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The targeted
goal of the Open Source project is important, but it does not
indicate whether a project will be successful or not. The goal will,
in part, give the development style needed. It seems to help that the
project starts with a goal, along with a chunk of code that shows the
goal is possible. But even this is not required. Some projects
started with the goal of &quot;a complete, Unix compatible, operating
system&quot;, and the first block of code available was a text
editor. But two decades later, that goal is accomplished. The thing
is this: did the GNU project &quot;cause&quot; the creation of the
complete Linux operating system? And how are the events causually
related? The point of all this is to understand successful Open
Source projects, such that people can reproduce the same results on a
new project, or even determine if Open Source is the way to go with
their project.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>One common
thread that runs through all successful Open Source projects is that
they operate in some form of Gift Exchange. The Gift Exchange creates
and builds community, and then the community brings its powers to
bear on the project. The community may contribute code or bug
reports. Individuals in the community may step forward and become
major contributers and developers on the project. And the individuals
in the community may do this for whatever internal reasons they have,
for altruistic charity, to scratch a personal itch, for pride and
honor, for a nice homestead on the noosphere, or in an attempt to put
Microsoft (or other random third party) out of business. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The personal
motivations of the community appear to be irrelevant, since they
appear to have no measurable commonality, nothing that would provide
a barometer of future success.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>What DOES
appear to be important, though, is that the project be a gift to the
community. Successful Open Source projects traffic in a Gift Exchange
of one form or another.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>What is
missing, however, is a means to more objectively measure the degree
to which a particular software project is trafficking in the world of
Gift Exchange and the degree to which it is trafficking in Commodity
Exchange. As it turns out, those measures have been developed over
several hundred years and codified in the laws of Intellectual
Property.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>So, I'm about
to seque into Intellectual Property law. By understanding the
specific measures available in the law, we can quickly determine
whether a project will be a successful Open Source project or whether
it would be better suited to a Commodity Exchange model instead.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>I'm also
making the seque after having just established the concepts of Gift
Exchange and Commodity Exchange. And as it happens, these are some
very useful models to apply not only when looking at Open Source
projects specifically, but also when looking at Intellectual Property
law in general. </FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">If you are a citizen of
country that has a marginally representational government, consider
yourself in a civilized country. Civilized people come to some manner
of agreement regarding how they expect everyone to behave towards one
another. Your representational government then articulates these
agreements into some form of law. The government's job is to act as
an unbiased agent, creating and enforcing the laws that represent the
will of the people. If you do not like a particular law, then you
should petition your representatives to change it to what you think
the law should be. It is then up to your government to balance your
petition with the rest of the population and the Public Good.

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">But, simply complaining

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="The Origin of Intellectual Property"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">The
Origin of Intellectual Property</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>From whom,
what, where, when, and why does Intellectual Property (IP) first
originate? If you live in the United States, the majority of
Intellectual Property laws stem from the US Constitution, Section 8,
which states that &quot;Congress shall have the power ... To promote
the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited
Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
respective Writings and Discoveries; ...&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>So, the 'what'
that IP law comes from is the US Constitution. The 'where' would be
Section 8 which lists the specific powers of Congress. The 'when'
would be 1788, when the Constitution was ratified. The 'why' is &quot;to
promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts&quot;. The 'who' that
originates IP law is Congress. But Congress gets its power from the
people, or in other words, the Public. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>IP law
originates from the Public. We the people give inventors and authors
the gifts specified in Intellectual Property laws. Somewhere along
the line, this little morsel has been lost by many in the hustle and
bustle of computer technology. It is an important factoid, so I'll
return to it shortly.</FONT></P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Writings and Discoveries"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">Writings
and Discoveries</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>And what does
Section 8 of the Constitution mean when it says &quot;Writings and
Discoveries&quot;?</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>First of, it's
important to point out that the Constitution did NOT say &quot;Ideas
and Knowledge&quot;. Nor did it say &quot;Facts and Information&quot;.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The natural
state of ideas is that they are free. There may be a cost associated
with developing an idea that you didn't previously have, and there
may be a cost associated with transmitting the idea to others. But
the 'conservation of energy' does not apply to ideas. One person can
have an idea just as easily as one BILLION people can. Ideas
effectively cost nothing. Ideas, knowledge, facts, and information
all fall into this same category of being free. For the most part,
these are interchangable vocabulary, though I'll try to stick with
the words &quot;Ideas or Knowledge&quot;. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The First
Amendment explicitely states that &quot;Congress shall make no law
respecting ... or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
press;...&quot; The Supreme Court soon established that this
protected an individual (or the press) from charges of defamation as
long as what they were saying/printing was &quot;true&quot;. So,
&quot;Writings and Discoveries&quot; does not mean &quot;Free Speech&quot;
or &quot;truths&quot; either. The First Amendment right to free
speech, to speak the truth, does not &quot;Trump&quot; Section 8 of
the Constitution. Freedom of Speech is the life-blood of any
democratic nation, and it must take priority over Intellectual
Property laws. While Freedom of Speech may not allow you to yell
&quot;Fire&quot; in a crowded theatre. Freedom of Speech DOES allow
you to yell &quot;Fire&quot; in a crowded, burning threatre.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>So to what is
Section 8 referring when it says &quot;Writings and Discoveries&quot;?
</FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>A &quot;Writing&quot;
is a specific expression of an idea in fixed form. &quot;Writings&quot;
are covered under Copyright Law. &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the play by
William Shakespeare, is a Writing, a specific expression of an idea
(Suspense Thriller story) written down on paper. The &gt;idea&lt; of
a &quot;Suspense Thriller&quot; is not a Writing. &quot;Hamlet&quot;,
the movie with Mel Gibson as the moody Dane, is another Writing. &quot;All
Along the Watchtower&quot;, the song penned by Bob Dylan, is another
Writing. &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; performed by Jimi
Hendrix and recorded on magnetic tape is another &quot;Writing&quot;
as well.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>It turns out
that the movie &quot;Hamlet&quot; is a Derived Work of the play
&quot;Hamlet&quot; by Shakespeare. Derived works are a distinction of
Copyright Law, which I'll cover later.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>A &quot;Discovery&quot;
is a &quot;new&quot;, &quot;useful&quot;, &quot;nonobvious&quot;
invention (a device or a method of manufacture). &quot;Discoveries&quot;
are covered under Patent Law. To receive patent protection, the
inventor must reveal the complete workings of the device in the
patent application. These applications then become available to the
public. Patent number 4,000,000 covers a &quot;Process for recycling
asphalt-aggregate compositions&quot;. Patent number 4,000,001 covers
a &quot;Hydrodynamic precipitation method and apparatus&quot;. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Copyright
grants the Author of a specific expression, for a fixed duration, the
right to control who copies, distributes, and creates derived works
of that expression. Patent law grants the creator of a specific
invention, for a fixed duration, the right to control who can
manufacture, use, and sell an invention. After copyright and patent
rights expire, the works return to the Public Domain, and anyone can
do with the ideas as they see fit. I'll cover copyright and patent
law in more detail in a little bit, but this is the one paragraph
introduction.</FONT></P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="IP Law as Gift Exchange Community"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">IP
Law as Gift Exchange Community</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>So, returning to that little factoid from earlier, IP
law originates from the Public. The Constitution grants the power to
Congress, and Congress gets its mandate from &quot;We the People&quot;.
So who originates IP law has been established. Now, who recieves the
benefit of IP law? IP law originates from the Public, and it
bequeaths a gift to the individual inventor or writer. Copyright and
Patent law grants or gifts the author or inventor of a work specific
rights over the work. IP law is a gift from the Public to the author
or inventor of a specific work.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>This actually follows the same form of a Barn-Raising
from the community to an individual farmer. The Public at large
promises to grant a certain set of rights to any inventor or writer
regarding a specific expression or a specific invention. IP law also
follows the Barn-Raising analogy with respect to how it fits in a
Gift Exchange community. A community gifts an individual farmer with
a Barn-Raising. It is a true gift in the sense that there is no sense
of obligation laid upon the farmer receiving the gift. However, that
farmer can take the benefit of the Barn-Raising and give it back to
the community by giving his time to someone else's Barn-Raising. The
community as a whole benefits over the long run by gifting an
individual with a Barn-Raising. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>IP law is a similar Gift Exchange from the Public to an
individual. In effect, the Public is proclaiming, &quot;Look, we know
ideas are free. We know that once someone writes something down or
invents something new, it would take very little to have the whole
world just copy and use that work. But We the People promise to gift
certain rights to any inventor or writer such that they have
sufficient time to profit from their specific work. We the People
understand that this will benefit the Public as a whole in the long
run.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Section 8 sets up the promise of a &quot;Barn-Building&quot;
Gift Exchange to any inventor or writer. The Public will gift certain
benefits to any individual willing to accept the gift. And the Public
realizes that they are surrendering something of value, a gift, to
the individual. The Gift is given with no obligation, no sense of
indebtedness left with the reciever. And the Public gives this gift
freely, without attempting to manipulate or dominate, with the sole
intention of creating a Gift Exchange Community that will benefit the
Public as a whole.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Authors and inventors are granted monopolies on
specific rights for a fixed duration. This gift from the Public to
the individual authors and inventors returns two benefits to the
community as a whole. First, the law states that the rights expire
after a fixed length of time, after which the work returns to its
natural state of Public Domain. Therefore any new work will
eventually return to the community. Secondly, even while the state of
individual monopoly is in effect on the work, the Public still
benefits from having the work available for purchase. A chemical
formula that cures cancer may be under Patent protection for twenty
years before it's Public Domain, but at least someone was willing to
spend the Billions of dollars needed to discover and invent the cure
in the first place.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Another way to think of it is as a perfect &quot;Endowment
for the Arts and Sciences&quot; program. Rather than having to put
money up front to give artists and inventors with the hope that they
create something valuable, the Government, and therefore the Public,
promises Copyrights and Patent rights to qualified works, and if the
market finds them valuable, the creators will be rewarded in kind. If
the work is crud, only the creator loses. The Public pays nothing up
front, rewards only those works which are marketably good, and pays
nothing if the work is unmarketable. Placed in the ideal model of
conservation of energy in a Commodity Exchange, this is an excellent
way to encourage good research and good writing, with the Public
spending no money on unmarketable products.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Some might argue that the Gift that comes from IP law
is not a true gift, since the rights granted to the author or
inventor eventually expire, that it is a temporary gift, and then it
is taken back. However, the natural state of ideas is that they are
free. The Constitution was drafted long after the printing press was
invented, and many considered the transmission cost of ideas to be
nearly zero. The First Amendment freedom of press was written with
the knowledge that there would be a press dissemenating information
to the people for little cost per reader. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The natural state of ideas is not that they are
property that belongs to the inventor. When Copyright and Patent
rights expire and the works are placed in the Public Domain, the
natural rights of the inventor or author are not being stripped away
and hijacked by the Public. The rights being granted are not natural
property of the inventor or author.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The natural state of Writings and Discoveries is that
they are free. IP law creates unnatural, legally sanctioned
monopolies as a gift to authors and inventors. The authors and
inventors can then use this gift to profit from their Writings and
Discoveries. These gifts may be of fixed duration, but they are still
a gift. Giving a friend a magazine subscription is still a gift even
if the subscription lasts only one year. You are giving the person
something of value that they did not have prior to giving them the
gift. IP law gives inventors and authors something they would not
have otherwise, monopolistic control over certain aspects of their
work. The fact that this gift eventually expires and the work is
returned to the Public Domain does not negate that a gift was still
given.</P>

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The diagram above shows the basic Intellectual Property
timeline. It exemplifies the fact that IP rights are naturally
Public. Prior to an invention being discovered or an expression being
written, anyone can discover or write the invention or expression.
The right is Public. Once someone creates the invention or
expression, that person is granted certain rights over their
creation. After a time, though, these rights expire and return to
their natural, Public state.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="The Limit of Public Good"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">The
Limit of Public Good</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Any Gift Exchange has its limits beyond which the
community spreads itself too thin. The value of an individual gift
could be so large that the person giving the gift cannnot be
self-sufficient while waiting for the community to balance out the
gift. Or the value of the gift may be small, but the time between
individual gift transactions is so long that the individual cannot be
self-sufficient while waiting for the community to balance out the
gift. In either case, the individual giver becomes overextended, and
the community as a whole cannot sustain itself. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>In a farming community, if Barn-Raisings are few and
far between, a person giving a gift of time and energy may never see
the community gift that energy back to everyone who contributed. Or
if an individual must contribute so much that they cannot sustain
themselves, the Gift Exchange community will eventually burn itself
out and collapse. This is the limit of Public Good in any Gift
Exchange community.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Likewise, in IP law, there is a limit to Public Good.
Beyond this limit, either the Public pays too high a price in rights
surrendered to authors and inventors, or the duration is too long for
the Public to ever see any benefit given back to the community.
Patents grant the inventor, for twenty years, the right to use, sell,
and manufacture the invention. Copyright grants the author, for the
life of the author plus seventy years, the right to copy, modify, and
distribute the work. Any more rights surrendered by the Public would
likely not benefit the Public Good. If the duration for those rights
exceeded the ones already determined, it would likely not benefit the
Public Good.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The plot below is a graph that shows Public Rights on
one axis, and the duration those rights could be surrendered on the
other axis. Also shown is the limit of Public Good with respect to
Intellectual Property laws. Beyond this arc, the Public either
surrenders rights that are too valuable or too precious, or the
Public surrenders a right for too long a duration. In either case,
the Public Good pays too heavy a price, and the community benefit of
the Gift Exchange is negated. In short, &quot;very bad things&quot;
happen when Intellectual Property law is pushed beyond the arc
marking the limit of Public Good.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Also note that the vertical axis has a second label
that shows the rights moving from &quot;Marketplace Commodity&quot;
to &quot;Personal Beliefs&quot;. Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution
also grants Congress the power to regulate Commerce. This is
&quot;Marketplace Commodity&quot; towards the bottom of the chart. On
the other extreme, the First Amendment prohibits Congress from making
any law regarding the establishment of religion or the observance
thereof. This falls under the heading of &quot;Personal Beliefs&quot;
at the very top of the chart. The bottom of the diagram concerns
interactions **between** individuals, especially in Commodity
Exchange scenarios. The further up the chart, the more the rights
become &quot;internalized&quot; in a single individual. Until the
very top of the chart reflects an individual's internal mind-set,
over which Congress has no power.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>There are three boxes in the chart marked &quot;Trade
Secrets Gone Bad&quot;, &quot;WIPO/DMCA&quot;, and &quot;UCITA&quot;.Just
note their location for now, and I'll come back to them in due time.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Once the Gift is Given"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">Once
the Gift is Given</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Once a gift is given in a Gift Exchange, the
transaction ends. The gift is the sole property of the person
receiving it. There can be no expectation that the receiver must pass
the gift along to someone else. If this expectation exists, the
transaction is a deception, a Commodity Exchange disguised as a Gift
Exchange. There is nothing better or worse about a Gift Exchange
versus a Commodity Exchange. However, there is something bad about
decieving people into thinking you are Giving them a gift, when in
actuality, you have an expectation for reciprocation of the gift. If
this is present, it is not a true Gift Exchange.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Therefore, with respect to IP law, once the Gift of
rights is given from the Public to the individual creator, that
transaction ends. The Gift of rights changes into Property that the
creator can sell in a Commodity Exchange or give away to other people
in a Gift Exchange. But from that point, the creator gets to choose
how to treat the Intellectual Property. A true gift does not place
expecations on the receiver to do something with the Gift. If there
are expectations, then it is a Commodity Exchange.</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="First Goal"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">First
Goal</A></H1>
<P>It is time to revisit the first goal I stated in the open
paragraphs of this document. 
</P>
<P><I>My goal is to create a good, usable, working model of
intellectual property. </I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The model of Intellectual Property law that I have
stated, in short, is this:</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="IP as Gift the Short Version"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">IP
as Gift, the Short Version</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Ideas and Knowledge is naturally free. The Public
granting an author or inventor rights over their specific work for a
limited duration creates a Gift Exchange community. This Gift
encourages people to risk development time and energy for the
possibility of the personal profit. The Public Good benefits
immediately because the specific writings and inventions are
available for purchase from the owner, and the Public Good benefits
in the long term because the rights to the work eventually return
back to the Public Domain. </B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Once the Gift of IP rights is given from the Public
to the individual creator, it becomes that individual's property. The
creator can then traffic their property rights in either a Commodity
Exchange or in a Gift Exchange. In either case, energy is conserved
and the Public benefits.</B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Any Gift Exchange has a limit to which it can no
longer sustain itself. Either the value of a Gift is too large for a
giver to bear its weight, or the delay between gifts is so long that
a giver will never see the energy of the gift be returned. In
Intellectual Property law, this limit is a function of the value or
importance of the Right surrendered by the Public and the duration
for which the Right is surrendered. This limit is represented in the
&quot;Limit of Public Good&quot; diagram.</B></P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Turning Current Models on Their Heads"></A><A HREF="#Part 1">Turning
Current Models on Their Heads</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>I commonly hear one of two basic models towards
Intellectual Property laws:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0in">&quot;Intellectual
	Property is a natural right of the inventor or author.&quot;</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0in">&quot;Intellectual
	Property is an outdated concept. Software (Music, Movies, pick your
	IP work of choice) should be Free!&quot;</P>
</OL>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Model (1) ignores the fact that the natural state of
ideas is that they are free for anyone to copy and use as they see
fit. IP law takes a specifc work out of this natural state and places
it in a legally created and legally sanctioned monopoly for a limited
duration. Intellectual Property is not a natural right of the
inventor or author, it is a right granted (Gifted) by the Public to
the inventor or author which lasts for a fixed duration. Furthermore,
those lobbying for more rights to authors and inventors have recently
pushed the laws beyond the limit of Public Good. The &quot;Limit of
Public Good&quot; diagram should clarify where the Public Good has
been breeched.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Model (2) ignores the fact that Intellectual Property
law creates a Gift Exchange community which benefits the Public as a
whole over time. By promising authors and inventors the gift of
control over their works as a means to profit from their efforts,
people are encouraged to reseach and develop new Writings and
Inventions. These works benefit the Public Good as they add to the
body of knowledge in the Arts and Sciences when they are created.
They also benefit the Public because they are now available when
previously they were not. And they also benefit the Public Good when
the rights expire and the works return to their natural state of
Public Domain. View (2) also ignores the fact that new writings and
inventions require development time and energy, and that IP law
grants a short term monopoly for a authors and inventors to profit
from their work to recoup their development costs. Ideas may be free,
but Writings and Inventions generally cost money to develop. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>I need to cover IP law in greater detail to further
refine the head-standing effects. But this is a good start. Detailing
IP law also dovetails nicely with the next goal, which is to create a
model for repeatably successful Open Source projects. So lets look at
the law in more detail.</P>

Specific Laws Affecting Giftware</B></FONT></H1>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Laws Affecting Open Source"></A><A HREF="#Part 2">Laws
Affecting Open Source</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>I briefly introduced copyright and patent laws above.
However, more detail is needed to understand the nuances of how these
laws affects Open Source projects. Also, Open Source is affected by a
number of laws outside the realm of copyright and patent law. This
includes Trademark and Warranty laws. Also, a number of laws are not
used by Open Source projects, but are used by proprietary authors.
And it is useful in understanding the tools that are used by non-Open
Source software. This includes Contract and Trade Secret law.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>So, I'm about to seque into a more detailed look at
various laws. But the intention is to create a usable model for
repeatably successful Open Source projects. I'll explore the details
of the various fields of law originating from the point of view of a
Gift Exchange. Hopefully, a useful model will become obvious as the
legal details are revealed. Because there are so many fields, though,
I'll first map out the general areas that I'll explore. This will
then serve as a reference as I go along.</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Broad Fields of Law affecting Open Source"></A>
<A HREF="#Part 2">Broad Fields of Law affecting Open Source</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>There are several broad fields of law that affect Open
Source, including: copyright, patent, trade secret, liability,
trademark, contract law, and Free Speech rights. The diagram below,
&quot;IP Spectrum ...&quot;, is my attempt to show all these fields
in a manner that indicates their interrelatedness. I will refer to
this diagram as I go through the specific details of the laws
affecting Open Source. These laws are shown mapped into a Gift
Exchange versus a Commodity Exchange.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Once an inventor or author recieves the Gift of
Intellectual Property rights from the Public, the inventor or author
can use those IP rights any way they wish. Therefore, from the point
of view of the owner, it is useful to show how the owner can use IP
law to then operate in a Commodity Exchange or in a Gift Exchange.
Therefore, I've remapped various fields of law into the point of view
of the IP owner, with Gift Exchange and Commodity Exchange acting as
endpoints along an entire spectrum.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The ideal Commodity Exchange is a model of equal energy
transfer between buyer and seller. However, the real world has
buyer's markets and seller's markets. And a Commodity Exchange in the
real world has laws and factors which push the transactions into a
buyer's advantage or seller's advantage. Therefore, I created a
second diagram specifically for instances where the inventor or
author is choosing to operate in the Commodity Exchange. This diagram
of &quot;Commodity Exchange Markets&quot; shows how different factors
pull the transaction further away from the ideal balance. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The horizontal axis simply holds different instances of
influence, which are specific Laws (UCITA, DMCA, etc). There is no
relationship between the various points on the x-axis really, except
that each point indicates a different law. (Well, there may be a
relationship, but I have not discovered one.) So, further right or
further left on the horizontal scale does not neccesarily indicate
&quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; or anything like that. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Go back to the &quot;Limits Of Public Good&quot;
diagram earlier in this document. Remember I said I'd get to those
boxes labeled &quot;WIPO/DMCA&quot; and &quot;UCITA&quot;? Well, here
they are again. WIPO/DMCA and UCITA go beyond the limit of Public
Good established by Copyright law and Patent law because the Rights
surrendered by the Public are too valuable. Furthermore, WIPO and
UCITA create a seller's market, pushing the balance of trade in favor
of the Intellectual Property owner over the Public buyer. I will
explore some of the details of WIPO/DMCA and UCITA later in the
following section.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The vertical axis indicates to which direction the
Commodity Exchange has tilted out of balance. The higher the point,
the more the influencing agent is creating a Seller's Market (Top).
The lower the point, the more the influence is creating a Seller's
Market (Bottom). The ideal situation would have every Commodity
Exchange transaction balance evenly, buyer and seller exchanging
goods for a reasonable price, a conservation of energy. This is
represented by the horizontal line.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>So,
I've introducted copyright law and patent law which come from the
powers granted to Congress in Section 8 of the Constitution. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Before
I go into anymore detail about IP law, I feel compelled to explore an
area where Congress has no power, as stated in the First Amendment of
the Constitution:</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The
First Amendment states that &quot;Congress shall make no law ...
abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the
people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a
redress of grievances.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The
reason I feel compelled to bring this up now is because of one
fundamental, and very important concept:</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium">
<FONT SIZE=3>Software is, first and foremost, speech.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Software is nothing more
than a human expression in what is sometimes an odd and usually rigid
language. The expression is usually saved in electronic format, but
that is no different from this document. The languages are different
(English versus Perl, for example), but that is no different than
English versus Latin. The one and only thing that distinguishes
software from other human expression is that software is always
written in a language whose grammar is suficiently rigid that a
computer can interpret and react to it. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">The same elements of
language and expression that brought forth Hamlet can now be used as
cogs and gears to control a machine. Jaquard's Loom built around 1790
used punch cards to control a loom which could then repeatedly weave
complex patterns into fabrics. The holes of the punch cards acted as
part of the machine. But now, human text can be used as the cog in
the machine. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">A computer can read and
react to a written document as if it were a set of gears. But it is
still first and foremost, a document protected under Free Speech.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Software is nothing more
than a <B>description</B> of an algorithm, a series of instructions
that a person or computer could perform, though one might be slower
than the other. Software by itself is not the --<B>enaction--</B> of
the algorigthm, it is a --<B>description</B>-- of the algorithm.
Software is equivalent to a very formally defined recipe, with which
you could bake a &quot;cake&quot; if you decided to act on the
recipe. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Software is a recipe. You
don't actually bake the cake unless you execute the program.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">While the text can be read
and used by the machine, it is still text. That is not a problem in
and of itself, but when proprietary interests prevent the
distribution of text files, it becomes a matter of Intellectual
Property Law versus Free Speech. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Copyright law prevents the
copying, distribution, and deriving of a specific expression without
the author's consent. It does not, however, place any restrictions on
the knowledge embodied in the expression. The Public never
surrendered the right to knowledge, the right to information, when it
granted copyrights to authors. As long as you put the knowledge in
your own words, copyright law does not apply, and it is Free Speech.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Patent Law prevents the
use, manufacture, and sale of a specific invention. But it requires
the workings of the invention be made public. The patent office
allows the Public to view patents freely online. Patent law actually
facilitates the Public dissemenation of knowledge regarding all
patented inventions. The Public never surrendered the right to
disseminate knowledge when it granted patent rights to inventors.
Patent law has no power over the right to Free Speech.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">No where in Section 8 of
the Constitution is it stated or implied that Intellectual Property
law should be used in any way to limit Free Speech.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">In fact, the First
Amendment must be read as a complete exclusion of any act of Congress
from the arena of Free Speech.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Congress
shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, &quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Free Speech and artistic
expression can be sold as a commodity, and the sale may fall under
the realm of Regulating Commerce. Copyright and patent law can be
applied to specific inventions and specific artistic expressions, and
the inventor and authors have specific rights gifted to them. But the
underlying Free Speech cannot be squelched. Free Speech trumps any
power of Congress 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">When a person describes an
algorithm in the strict grammar of the C language, it is still Free
Speech. Simply because Free Speech is embodied in a language rigid
enough to be read and used by a computer does not nullify the fact
that the C language was created so that humans could write
expressions in it. As computers become more and more advanced, they
will be more and more able to read and react to plain English. As
this happens, either Free Speech protection will slowly be stripped
from any English expression that a computer can act upon, or Congress
will finally realize that software is Free Speech, pure and simple.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">The &quot;Anarchist's
Cookbook&quot; is a book that gives recipes on how to build bombs and
other diversions. While some may consider the book to be of
questionable benefit to the Public, the answer to that question is a
matter of Public choice rather than one of Government censorship. The
book is protected under the First Amendment. A recipe for a bomb is
NOT an actual bomb. While Congress can make the possession of a bomb
illegal, it cannot make it illegal to possess the knowledge on how
build a bomb, or to distribute that knowledge to others. Speech alone
cannot be abridged by Congress, and is therefore Free.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Software cracking tools are
protected under Free Speech. Using cracking tools to break into
someone's computer is illegal. But using them and
possessing/understanding/analyzing them are two separate
distinctions. As reprehensible as you might find the idea of cracking
tools being freely available on the internet, outlawing them would be
no different than outlawing &quot;The Anarchist's Cookbook&quot;. And
once you outlaw one, the rest become arbitrary conveniences. Some
software programs originally started as cracking tools and morphed
into Security Administration tools, programs to help sysadmins make
sure their computers are secure. The exchange of knowledge created
tools to help make computer systems more secure. The distinction
between a cracking tool and a sysadmin tool becomes arbitrary and
subjective.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Congress has attempted to
put restrictions on speech that meets the definition of &quot;legally
obscene&quot;. But this only exemplifies just how arbitrary and
subjective the qualitative features of speech truly is. When Supreme
Court Justice John Paul Stevens said &quot;I can't define
pornography, but I'll know it when I see it&quot;, it becomes clear
just how arbitrary any qualitative measure of speech really is. One
man's obscenity is another man's poetry.

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>If
it is written or spoken in a language meant to express ideas, it is
Free Speech.</FONT></P>

understanding, or development. This is not a valid interpretation of
&quot;To Promote the Progress of Arts and Sciences&quot;. IP law was
never intended to silence schools that teach how the invention works
or individuals that trade knowledge embodied in an invention or
expression. Far more important than the Gift of copyrights and patent
rights given to individual authors and inventors, the Public right to
SPEAK must not be subverted. The right to Criticize, to Satire, to

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Copyright Law"></A><A HREF="#Part 2">Copyright
Law</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">Copyright l</SPAN>aw
gives the author of a creative expression (a work) the exclusive
right to <B>copy</B>, <B>distribute</B>, and <B>create derivative
works</B> their expression. The author can grant these rights to
other people via a license. Once a user has a legally obtained copy
of the author's work, copyright law does not generally grant the
author control over how the software is used by that user. Usage is
generally regulated by Contract Law. Copyright law is mainly
concerned with the rights granted to the author of a work: copying,
distributing, and deriving. Unless the author grants these rights to
someone, no one can copy, distribute, or derive the work but the
author.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Copyright is an established international concept. The
Berne convention (Paris, 1971) is an international copyright treaty
signed by 96 countries, including the United States. Each country's
legal system must provide protection to the author with regard to the
rights of the treaty. Some of this document may be relevant to the
United States only, even though all these countries signed the
treaty, each country can enact its own laws. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Copyright protection is automatic as soon as the work
is in a fixed form, such as in writing, on a recording, or stored on
a harddrive. You do not have to register with the Copyright Office
for your work to be protected by copyright law, although registration
does have its benefits. For example, you must register your work with
the Copyright Office prior to bringing a lawsuit against someone for
copyright infringment. The registration filing fee is $30, uses a
simple two page form you can fill out yourself, and must be
accompanied by two copies of your work. It's a relatively
straightforward process, although the processing period, up to eight
months, can be a bit tedious.</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Copyright Copyright Notice"></A><A HREF="#Part 2">Copyright:
Copyright Notice</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>A <B>copyright</B> <B>notice</B> is not required on the
work for the work to be protected. If you <B>do</B> put a notice on
your work, the format is 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Copyright &copy; &lt;year&gt; &lt;name_of_author&gt;</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Using a 'c' in parenthesis, i.e. &quot;(c)&quot;, may
or may not have legal recognition, so use the 'c' in a full circle to
be safe &gt;&gt;&gt; &copy; &lt;&lt;&lt;. You can append &quot;All
Rights Reserved&quot; on the end of the notice if that's how you want
to license your work. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you do not put a copyright notice on your work, be
aware that you're only creating confusion, since people can't copy,
distribute, or derive a work without the author's consent. A lack of
a copyright notice does not grant that consent, it only makes it
harder for people to figure out from whom they need to get consent. A
lack of a copyright notice does not put the work in the Public
Domain. (Public Domain is explained below.) 
</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Copyright Expression not Functionality"></A>
<A HREF="#Part 2">Copyright: Expression not Functionality</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Copyright law protects expression, not functionality.
Say I write a story where two people meet, fall in love, get torn
apart by their families, and commit suicide in the end because they
can't be together. Copyright law grants me a monopoly on my
expression, my version, of the story. But copyright law does not
grant me a monopoly on all stories with that plot. The same concept
holds with software as well. Say I write a program that lets you
balance your checkbook. Copyright law grants me a monopoly on the
specific expression of the program that I wrote. Copyright law does
not grant me a monopoly on all accounting programs. Copyright law
will grant me a monopoly on my specific expression of a Graphical
User Interface (GUI) based Operating System (OS). But copyright law
does not grant me a monopoly on all GUI based OS's. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>A legal monopoly on some specific functionality is
possible via a Patent, which I'll discuss later.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Copyright does not grant a monopoly on functionally
equivalent programs. This is an important distinction about copyright
law to keep in mind when dealing with software. There are different
versions of Unix which are functionally equivelant, but each version
has a different copyright holder. Just because someone is granted
copyright protection on a program they wrote, that does not mean that
copyright law then prevents anyone else from writing their own
version of the program. The only requirement is that the new author
must write their version from scratch; they can't cut and paste
someone else's expression into their new code and claim it as their
own. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Copyright law does not apply to software interfaces,
because they fall under the realm of functionality not expressions.
Therefore, copyright does not give someone a monopoly on operating
system commands. Anyone can write software that has a directory
listing command &quot;ls&quot;. An object oriented class defintion
may declare certain subroutines with certain names. Copyright law
does not grant such an author a monopoly over all classes with those
subroutine names. Nor does copyright law grant the author control
over how that class is used or inherited. (Copyright law has little
say over usage, remember?) If I write a class definition with certain
subroutine declarations, I cannot prevent someone from inheriting my
class and overloading my subroutines. Inheriting is in the realm of
use, and overloading is in the realm of functional interfaces.
Copyright law says that no one can cut and paste the code from my
subroutine into their subroutine and claim it as their own. But
copyright law does not give me control over how someone uses my code
or independently generated code with similar functionality.</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Copyright Derived Works"></A><A HREF="#Part 2">Copyright:
Derived Works</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Copyright gives the author a monopoly on derived works.
Some people refer to creating derived works as the right to &quot;modify&quot;
the work, but 'modify'ing the work is only a subset of all possible
ways in which a work may be derived. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>A derived work could be a version of my love story with
the last chapter changed such that the two lovers get to live
together happily ever after. A derived work also covers translations
into other languages. I may have written my original story in
English. Copyright law says that no one can write a version of my
story in Japanese and claim it as theirs. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Derived works apply to the realm of software as well. A
patch applied to a piece of software creates a derived work similar
to rewriting the last chapter of a book. Compiling source code into
an executable creates a derived work similar to translating from
English to Japanese. Likewise, decompiling an executable into source
code creates a derived work as well.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>My layman's interpretation is that Copyright law does
not prevent someone from translating someone else's work into
Japanese for their personal use. Copyright law would however prevent
that person from selling that translation without the author's
consent. Likewise, copyright law would not prevent someone from
decompiling someone else's executable for their personal use.
However, copyright law would prevent that person from distributing
that decompiled code. I believe the main reason that &quot;deriving&quot;
is controlled by copyright law is so that an author is not &quot;locked
out&quot; by someone else's unauthorized sequel.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>For example, say I write a story that involves three
main characters, and those characters have names, attributes,
recurring manerisms, cliches that they use, and so on. Say I write a
story with these three characters, register it with the copyright
office, and sell the book on the market. Now, lets say someone comes
along, reads my story, writes a sequel without my permission, uses my
characters, continues my plot line, and attempts to register it with
the copyright office. Their copyright is invalid because they cannot
make a derived work without my permission. They did not copy my
original work, nor did they distribute their sequel. However, if
derived works weren't controlled by the author, someone could write a
sequel to my book, register it with the copyright office, and then
accuse me of infringing on &quot;their&quot; story, even though their
story was an unauthorized sequel to my book.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>It is my lay opinion that copyright law's stand on
derived works is not meant to be construed as to prevent translations
and modifications which are solely for someone's personal use.
Therefore, copyright law should not be taken to mean that you cannot
disassemble someone's executable to understand how it works.
Copyright law does not apply to knowledge, facts, or information,
only a specific expression.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Other's disagree with this opinion, so get a lawyer for
your situation.</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Copyright Linking is Deriving"></A><A HREF="#Part 2">Copyright:
Linking is Deriving</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>An oddity exists where Copyright Law meets software.
Source code, such as a C file, can be compiled into an object file.
The object file is considered a derived work, like English translated
into Japanese. The source code is the &quot;original&quot; language
of the software program. The object file is the source code
translated into a language that a microprocessor can understand and
execute. The object file is then often linked with other object files
to create an executable program. The act of linking goes into the
object file and replaces external function names with addresses where
those functions are located so that the functions can actually be
called by the program. Currently, this act of linking is legally
recognized as creating a derived work of the object file that is the
executable file.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The oddity is that while Copyright does not generally
concern itself with 'use', the only way to 'use' an object file is to
link it. My personal, non-lawyer, layman's opinion on the matter is
that linking is a purely functional act, like putting bookmarks in a
novel, making notes in a textbook, or filling in blanks on a form.
You have to &quot;modify&quot; a video tape from its original
physical form if you wish to play it; your VCR has to pull the tape
out of the cassette holder, wrap the tape around a drum, and mangle
it in innumerable ways. The way you 'modify' a video tape to play it
in a VCR is analagous to the way you have to 'modify' an object file
to execute the actual executable. An object file is unusable and
useless if you can't link it and create an executable. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The changes involved with linking has nothing to do
with the creative expression of the work, just like the changes made
to a video tape to physically play it have nothing to do with the
artistic expression on the tape. Placeholders are replaced with
specific addresses of subroutines. The change is purely functional
and utilitarian in nature. Conversely, unlinking an executable into
separate, stand-alone object files should be considered a purely
functional operation as well. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>However, the legal standing of linking is that linking
creates a derived works, and therefore falls under the control of
copyright law. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The reason I bring up &quot;Linking is deriving&quot;
is that it is used by the GNU General Public License in a particular
way. This legal recognition has an effect on what you can and cannot
do with software licensed under GPL. I'll take a look at this later.</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Copyright Public Domain"></A><A HREF="#Part 2">Copyright:
Public Domain</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Copyright protection lasts for the life of the author,
plus seventy years. If it is a corporate work, copyright protection
lasts either 120 years from creation or 95 years from publication,
whichever is shorter. Once copyright protection expires, the work
passes into Public Domain. The rights granted to the author return to
the Public. Anyone can copy, distribute, and derive the work as they
wish. One reason you see countless movies and plays based on
Shakespeare's work is because Shakespeare's works are Public Domain.
You can take a work in the Public Domain, modify it, and copyright
the derived work. Therefore, I could copyright my personal version of
Hamlet. Someone could film a movie version of Hamlet, have Mel Gibson
play the lead, and they could copyright that version. Creating a
derived version of a Public Domain work and copyrighting it is
sometimes called creating a Copyright Fork.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>If you wish to place your work directly into the Public
Domain, the current opinion is that you can't do it. &quot;Public
Domain&quot; is a legal term that can only be achieved by works that
have had their copyright protection expire (life of the author plus
70 years). Oddly, you can't just say your work is Public Domain and
have legal force. The closest you can do is attach a license to your
work that unconditionally grants everyone the right to copy,
distribute, and derive your work anyway they wish. These are the only
rights granted to an author by copyright, and by surrendering these
rights to the Public, you effectively let the world treat your work
as if it were in the Public Domain.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Since it is not likely that you have the time and money
to give away software that has some sort of guarantee behind it, you
should put a &quot;No Warranty&quot; disclaimer somewhere prominently
in the software. This let's the Public know that the software is
Public, but that you are offering it as Public on an &quot;As Is&quot;
basis.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Public Domain: A state reached by a work when the
monopoly granted by the Public to the author has expired, and the
rights return to the public as a whole. The monopoly expires 70 years
after the author's death. Anyone can copy, distribute, and derive a
work in the Public Domain.</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Copyright Copyright Fork"></A><A NAME="Copyright Public Domain1"></A>
<A HREF="#Part 2">Copyright: Copyright Fork</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Copyright Fork: a derived version of a Public work, and
the derived version is now someone's intellectual property. The
Public work remains Public. The derived version is proprietary. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Shakespeare's &quot;Hamlet&quot; is a Public work. The
movie &quot;Hamlet&quot; starring Mel Gibson is a proprietary derived

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Copyright
law grants the author a monopoly on the rights to copy, distribute,
and create derived works. However, this monopoly is not granted in
cases of &quot;Fair Use&quot;. Or, to put it in terms of the Public
Gift Exchange, the Public grants the author a monopoly on the rights
to copy, distribute, and derive the work, except when those rights
would be necessary for the Public to exercise &quot;Fair Use&quot;. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Note
that in the &quot;Intellectual Property Spectrum&quot; above, Fair
Use is in the far left hand side of the diagram. Fair Use refers to
rights which the Public did not grant and gift to the creator of the
work. Fair Use rights remain Public rights.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The
law enumerates some examples of Fair Use--criticism, comment, news
reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. However, the law does
not exclude other possibilities of Fair Use. An example of Fair Use
that is not defined in the law but came out of a Court decision is
&quot;home recording for personal use&quot; (The &quot;Betamax
Decision&quot;). Even though copyright law grants the author a
monopoly to prohibit someone from copying their work, that monopoly
does not apply when someone copies the work when it is a &quot;home
recording for personal use&quot;.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>One
intent of Fair Use is to protect Free Speech. Free Speech includes
critiquing someone's work. To critique someone's work it is often
necessary to quote excerpts from the person's work. It is much more
convincing if I say &quot;so and so's movie had horrible acting and
bad writing&quot; and then show a short clip from the movie to
support my claim. Otherwise, I've made an unsubstantiated claim.
However, quoting someone's work, or showing a clip from a movie, is
copying and distributing the work, and copying and distributing is
generally controlled by the author. Therefore Fair Use says that the
right to control who copies and distributes a work for purposes of
cricism is a Public Right and not a right granted to the author. Free
Speech trumps Copyright law.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Notice
that all the examples spelled out by the law involve communication
between individuals, i.e. SPEECH. Criticism, comment, news reporting,
teaching, scholarship, and research, ALL of these are examples of
individual's communicating information. All of these examples
reinforce the First Amendment right over the power in Section 8 of
the Constitution. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Free
Speech trumps Copyright and Patent law.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Another
intent of Fair Use, shown in the Betamax Decision, is to allow people
to make &quot;home recordings for personal use&quot;.People with
cable TV service have already paid to receive a copy of the programs
on cable. The Betamax case was an attempt by the Motion Picture
Association to prevent cable customers from using Betamax VCR's to
copy programs off of the cable. The movie industry was just getting
into the home video sales and rental business, and they wanted to
prevent people from taping movies off of the cable channels and force
consumers to purchase a tape instead. The courts ruled that VCR's had
a legitimate use, allowing consumers to make home recordings of
copyrighted material for personal use. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;home
recordings for personal use&quot; can be extended beyond VCR's. For
example, back in the &quot;old days&quot; of vinyl records and audio
cassettes, someone who bought a vinyl record could make a Fair Use
copy of that record to cassette. They could then play the record on
their home stereo and play the cassette in their car stereo.
Nowadays, when a person buys their music on DVD audio, they
reasonably expect to make Fair Use copies for their car stereo and
for their walkman. They would be quite upset to discover that DVD
machines subvert ALL Fair Use with built-in Copy-Prevention
mechanisms.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The
full extension of current Copy-Prevention devices will eventually
prevent all Fair Use independent of what the Public intended in its
grant of Copyrights to the author. I fully accept that I am not
allowed to SELL or DISTRIBUTE copies of the CD I purchased. This is
the entire point of copyright law, granting the author a monopoly to
copy, distribute, and modify their works. However, I do not believe
for one second that the Founding Fathers intended Copyright law to be
morphed into a nationwide Pay-Per-Play or Pay-Per-Medium system on
every artistic expression.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>When
I purchase a legal copy of a work, I expect to be able to play that
copy as many times as I wish without further payments to the vendor.
I expect to be able to make personal translations of that work for my
personal use without further payments to the vendor. I expect to be
able to copy a CD to a &quot;My Favorites&quot; mix CD, to copy the
CD to my MP3 player, to copy the CD to an MP3 compressed disc for my
car stereo, and to copy the CD to another MP3 disc for my other
Walkman.</FONT></P>

Copy-Prevention has the side effect of enforcing the seller's

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Patents"></A><A HREF="#Part 2">Patents</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">A patent grants an inventor
a monopoly on the manufacture, use, and sale of an invention. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">A patentable invention
includes a process or method for producing a useful, concrete and
tangible result. This has been legally recognized to include
software. You can't patent mathematical formula, but you can patent
the software that implements the formula to produce a specific
result. The invention must be &quot;novel&quot;, &quot;nonobvious&quot;,
and &quot;useful&quot;. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Patents grant a monopoly on
functionality. This has much farther reaching ramifications when
compared to copyright law. While copyright law protects a specific
expression of a program that an author writes, copyright law does not
prevent another person from writing their own version of the program
with the same functionality. Under copyright law, you can have
multiple, wholly independent works, which all implement the same
functionality.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Patent law grants the
inventor a monopoly over any device with the same functionality.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">According to patent law, if
I patent a program that produces a concrete and tangible result, then
NO ONE ELSE CAN USE THAT FUNCTIONALITY. No one else can write another
program that creates that same concrete and tangible result.
Copyright simply grants a monopoly on an author's expression. Another
author can write their own version of the program with the same
functionality but using a completely separate expression. Patent law
grants a monopoly on anything that produces the same result. Once a
patent is granted on a method that produces a tangible result, that
method is held as a monopoly by the patent holder, and it doesn't
matter how the method is implemented, it doesn't matter if I write my
own software in a clean room and never see the patented software. It
doesn't matter if I implement the software in a completely different
way. If the result is the same, it's patent infringment.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Obviously, patents are much
more powerful than copyright. In the &quot;Limit of Public Good&quot;
diagram, patent rights are higher, more severe, than the rights of
copyright. For this reason, the monopoly that a patent grants will
only last 20 years. This shorter duration keeps patent law within the
limit of Public Good. Furthermore, patents are not automatic like
copyright. Copyright protections are automatic as soon as the work is
saved to a file. Patents must be applied for, must pass the review of
the patent office, and must be approved. This generally requires the
inventor filling for a patent to hire a patent attorney to fill out
the patent application. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">The costs associated with a
patent are exhorbinant when compared to copyright registration. The
filing fee for copyright registration is $30. The basic filing fee
for a utility patent is $740. A utility patent issue fee is $1200.
Patent maintenance fees need to be paid to maintain the patent
rights, and their schedule is: $880 due at 3.5 years, $2020 due at
7.5 years, $3100 due at 11.5 years. On top of this, throw in the
inventor's attorney's fees, in the neighborhood of $200 an hour. And
after the application is filed, there's a waiting period for it to
get processed, and there is no guarantee that the application will be
approved.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Needless to say, such high
costs make it unlikely that software will ever be contributed to the
world under patent protection. Worse yet, software patents can have a
huge detrimental effect on an Open Source project.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">A patent holder's monopoly
on all implementations that produce the same concrete result means
that the patent holder can lock out Open Source implementations of
the same functionality. To further exacerbate the problem, the patent
office has shown a history of granting software patents for
inventions that many consider to be quite obvious and not very novel.
The XOR patent is one example (U.S. Patent #4,197,590). The One-Click
Patent is another (U.S. Patent #5,960,411). 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in"><I>&quot;It was never the
object of patent laws to grant a monopoly for every trifling device,
every shadow of a shade of an idea, which would naturally and
spontaneously occur to any skilled mechanic or operator in the
ordinary progress of manufactures. Such an indiscriminate creation of
exclusive privileges tends rather to obstruct than to stimulate
invention. It creates a class of speculative schemers who make it
their business to watch the advancing wave of improvement, and gather
its foam in the form of patented monopolies, which enable them to lay
a heavy tax on the industry of the country, without contributing
anything to the real advancement of the arts. It embarrasses the
honest pursuit of business with fears and apprehensions of unknown
liability lawsuits and vexatious accounting for profits made in good
faith.&quot; </I>

Copyright Fork does NOT prevent Alice from adding Bob's functioanlity
into her own code. Bob's copyright means that Alice will have to do
her own work to create her own expression of the functionality (in
fact, if Bob's Copyright Fork did not exist, Alice would have to do
her own work to create the functionality AND its expression. Bob's
Copyright Fork at least gives Alice a proof of concept.) Copyright
allows Alice to recreate Bob's functionality in her own code as long
as Alice does it in her own words.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>A
Patent Fork, on the other hand, would prevent Alice from re-creating
Bob's new functionality. Alice puts her work under a Public license.
Bob modifies Alices Public work, adds some patented energy to it, and
a Patent Fork is created. Alice will have to wait 20 years before she
can put Bob's functionality into her code. This could kill the Gift

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>A
Gift Exchange community requires that the momentum be conserved as
the gift changes from hand to hand. However, for many Gift Exchanges,
and especially a Software Gift Exchange, the community can only
contribute something if they can transform the momentum into
something new. The zero transmission cost of the internet means that
the community is not needed to simply transmit the momentum (files
can be posted for practically no cost without outside contributions.)
Therefore, the only way the community can contribute, the only way
the momentum can flow through the community, is if the individuals
can take the energy of the gift and transfer it into a different
form.</FONT></P>

from the Gift Exchange community. Their existence is of no concern to
the ebb and flow to momentum coursing through a Software Gift

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Trade Secrets"></A><A HREF="#Part 2">Trade
Secrets</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Prior to the creation of
Patent and Copyright laws, the only means that manufacturers had to
maintain a monopoly on their ideas and information was through Trade
Secrets. Basically, a Trade Secret is some information held in secret
by a company so they can use it to their market advantage. The
problem is that it was difficult to apply Trade Secrets to products
or information that is sold to the Public. Trade Secrets work well
for internal manufacturing methods and the like. But once the Public
learns the secret, it was impossible to prevent the Public from using
the information for their own advantage. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">For this reason, Patent and
Copyright protections were created to give vendors certain
protections for specific inventions and specific expressions which
were sold to the Public. Without patent and copyright law, I could
sell one copy of a Trade Secret gadget or novel, and then it would
become Public information. Patent and copyright laws were created to
protect vendors to allow them to sell their inventions and writings
to the Public and still allow the vendor certain rights to their
work.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Interestingly, some vendors
have attempted to place the power of Trade Secrets above and beyond
the power of Copyright and Patent law. Once an outside source
independently learns the same information of the Trade Secret, the
original Trade Secret owner has no recourse to protect their
invention and writings. Some vendors have attempted to apply Trade
Secret laws to Publicly available inventions and writings. But
Publicly available inventions and writings is only protectable within
the realm of copyright and patent law.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Trade Secret law is based
in state laws, not federal law. A trade secret is any recipe,
formula, device, collection of information known by someone that 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0in">provides that someone
	with a competitive advantage in the marketplace,</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0in">is treated by that
	someone such that the treatment can reasonably be expected to
	prevent the public or competitors from learning about it, absent
	improper acquisition or theft. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">The person who holds the
Trade Secret foregoes copyright and patent protection. Instead, the
owner decides that they will maintain the information as secret and
will achieve a monopoly that way. As long as the information remains
secret, the owner has a complete monopoly over the secret. However,
once the secret is independently discovered by someone else, the
original person holding the Trade Secret loses all advantages of a
Trade Secret.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Patents law requires that a
patent application describe the invention in complete detail. The
Public can then peruse the Patent Office archives and see how any
patented device works. The knowledge embodied in a patent is made
Public as soon as the patent is granted. But the inventor is
protected by patent law from anyone making, using, or selling the
patened device without the patent holder's permission. The Public
benefits immediately in two ways, first the knowledge is made Public
so that others can learn from it, second the invention can be made
available for sale by the inventor.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Someone operating in Trade
Secret law decides to forgo any protections available under patent
law. Instead, they choose to maintain a monopoly for as long as no
one else can independently create the secret. Once someone else
independently discovers the knowledge of the secret, the Trade Secret
holder loses any control over the Secret.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Trade Secret law can viewed
from a corporation's right to privacy. The &quot;Diagram of Public
Good&quot; shows the right to privacy as being near the top of the
chart in importance. If you or a corporation develops or discovers
new information or methods, the law cannot force you or the
corporation to reveal those methods. You do not have to give away you
grandmother's secret recipe for apple pie. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">In this fashion, the recipe
for Coca-Cola (tm) is a Trade Secret. And <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>it's
usually cited as an example whenever Trade Secret law is discussed.
Coca-Cola has been around for about a century. And it's been a trade
secret the whole time. Though it's a trade secret, that hasn't
prevented competing flavors from cropping up on the soft-drink
market. Personally, I can't tell the difference between Coca-Cola and
Pepsi. But as far as Trade Secrets go, the Coca-Cola trade secret is
rather benign.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The
company's 'right to privacy' can be protected by Trade Secret law.
Company employees will generally sign an employee agreement that
includes a Non-Disclosure Agreement. Basically, the employee promises
not to reveal the company's internal program, in exchange for gainful
employment. The company and the employee's act as a whole, and the
'right to privacy' model fits well.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Trade
Secret law works well for ideas, methods, and information that are
internal to a company. A web search company might develop internal
software to search the web for good information. This could easily be
treated as a Trade Secret. Another example would be a Computer
Graphics Imaging (CGI) company (those wizards that created the
computer animated insects, army men, and action figures) which
develops its own rendering software for use in-house. The software is
used only in-house and is never seen by the Public. All the Public
sees is the special effects clips generated by the CGI company.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Trade
Secret law is a bad fit for cases where the company wishes to sell
embodiments of the secret to the Public. Trade Secret law allows for
reverse engineering and independent development of the knowledge. If
someone outside the company independently develops the identical
information that is contained in the company's Trade Secret, then the
company has no recourse to prevent the outside person from using the
information as they see fit. In this light, holding the Coca-Cola
formula as a Trade Secret is probably not a good idea in this day and
age where chemical analysis could quite easily be used to discover
the chemical composition of Coca-Cola.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Copyright
and Patent laws were written with a balance to the Gift Exchange
community that it creates in mind, a respect for the Public Good, and
a recognition towards expected Fair Use. The Public offers copyright
and patent law to authors and inventors to protect their writings and
discoveries. But if someone wishes to forgo this offer of protection,
then they have to accept the consequences if outside sources develop
the same information. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Trade
Secret law has legitimacy from the point of view of an individual's
or company's &quot;right to privacy&quot;. The Public take on Trade
Secret could be summed up with &quot;Look, we know it would be Bad if
people or companies could not maintain a level of privacy from the
Public or even the Government, therefore we won't pry into any
knowledge that you develop on your own. However, don't expect any
Intellectual Property protection if someone else independently
develops the same knowledge and wants to make it Public.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Some
try to interpret Trade Secret law as the Public granting a rather
wide swath of important rights to the Trade Secret owner. These
rights include right to employment, right to reverse engineer, in
addition to the basic rights of patents and copyright. But when you
combine the Public surrender of these important rights with the fact
that Trade Secrets have no expiration date, you can quickly graph a
point on the &quot;Limit of Public Good&quot; diagram that is FAR,
FAR, outside the arc that shows the limit of Public Good.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">The DVD licensing
organization, DVDCCA, has claimed that DVD technology is a Trade
Secret. DeCSS is a function used in playing a DVD. Even if you
legally purchase a DVD disc, you can't play it unless you have a
device that can read it and perform DeCSS on the data. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">The DVDCCA brought Andrew
Bunner to court for Trade Secret misappropriation. Andrew posted
publicly available DeCSS software on his website. The software that
Andrew posted performed DeCSS on DVD data. It was a text file that
described, in grammatically rigid form, the steps needed to perform
DeCSS on the data. And it was rigid enough that a computer could read
it and actually perform the DeCSS function fast enough so that
someone could actually watch their DVD.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">A lower court agreed with
the DVD organization and placed an injunction against Andrew Bunner,
prohibiting him from putting that particular file on his website. In
laymen's terms, they prevented the distribution of a publicly
available document because the document described a Trade Secret.
Note, the distrubution of the document was not Copyright
infringement; it was not a document copyrighted by the DVD group.
Also note that patent infringment did not occur either. The DVD group
choose to avoid Patent protection, because patent protection would
require that they reveal the workings of their invention and because
patent protection only lasts two decades. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Instead, the DVD group
attempted to keep DeCSS technology a PERMANENT MONOPOLY via Trade
Secret law gone bad.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">But oddly, they attempted
to cover DeCSS under Trade Secret law while millions of DVD devices
were being sold to the public. So, it isn't much of a secret anymore.
Most Trade Secrets actually need to be kept from the Public, kept
secret, to maintain their Trade Secret status. I do not understand
how Trade Secret status can be maintained on any product that is sold
to the public at large (unless, of course, you sneak in a Shrink Wrap
Contract that says you agree not to reveal the secrets of the device
you just purchased. I discuss Shrink Wrap Contracts later.)</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Even if public distribution
of the embodiment of a Trade Secret does not disqualify the Trade
Secret, the important thing to note here is that somebody wanted to
play their DVD on Linux and nothing was available from the movie
industry to do this. So someone purchased a publicly available DVD
device, a number of books, and figured out what they needed to do to
play their DVD disk on their computer. This was in the form of a
software document that could be performed on a machine running Linux.
Then, the person distributed their document to the public. The
distribution of that document falls under Freedom of Speech.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Thankfully,
the ruling against Andrew Bunner has been overturned by an Appellate
court. The Appellate court ruled that Trade Secrets do not trump Free
Speech. </FONT>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Trademark Law"></A><A HREF="#Part 2">Trademark
Law</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Trademark law is sourced
from federal and state court rulings, federal law (the Lanham Act),
and state law. All states have trademark laws as well as laws against
unfair competition, which, among other things, prohibit a business
from using the name of an already existing business if it is likely
to confuse customers.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Trademark law provides
protection to marks (words, slogans, logos, etc) that identify and
distinguish a product or a service provided in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Note that &quot;identify
and distinguish&quot; is wholly distinct from &quot;describe&quot;.
Also note that &quot;marks (words, slogans, logos)&quot; is
completely different from &quot;generic terms&quot; and &quot;common
names&quot;. A company that provides web server software cannot
trademark &quot;web server&quot;, because that is a generic term that
simply describes what the product is. However, a company that
provides web server software could trademark the term &quot;Zob-Bot&quot;
and use it a a mark for &quot;Zob-Bot Web Server Software&quot;. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">From an English grammar
point of view, trademarks are &quot;proper nouns&quot;.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">You cannot trademark the
term &quot;Web Server&quot; to identify your software package. You
cannot trademark the term &quot;Web Browswer&quot; to identify your
software package. Both of these terms are generic terms that reflect
what the software package does. Apache is a trademark that identifies
a particular web server software package. Netscape is a trademark
that identifies a particular web browser program. Both of these
software packages are available under Open Source licenses.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Even if the term originally
qualified for trademark protection, if the Public begins to associate
the trademark with the product itself, then the trademark can lose
trademark status.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">&quot;Cellophane&quot; was
a trademark for plastic wrap. &quot;Aspirin&quot; was a brand
trademark for salicylic acid. &quot;Escalator&quot; was a trademark
to identify a moving staircase. All of these trademarks originally
identified a specific brand of a generic product. But as time passed,
the Public began to associate the trademark name as the name of the
product itself. Rather than &quot;Cellophane plastic wrap&quot;,
people simply referred to that thing as &quot;cellophane&quot;. The
trademark lost its trademark status.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">A successful trademark is
associated by the Public as a brand name of a product. A failed
trademark is associated as the product itself, regardless of
manufacturer.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Trademark law can be quite
useful for Open Source projects if used properly. I'll explain later.</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Warranty"></A><A HREF="#Part 2">Warranty</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>A
warranty is a guarantee about a product being sold. Warranty laws are
created at the state level. Although not all types of warranties are
required by law, two IMPLIED WARRANTIES are required in every state.
Unless the seller explicitely marks the product &quot;As Is&quot; or
indicates in writing that &quot;No Warranty&quot; is given, then all
products have an implied warranty. Several states do not allow &quot;As
Is&quot; sales. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Warranty
of Merchantability&quot; means that the product will work when used
for some reasonably expected purpose. A hammer will pound nails. A

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Warranty
of Fitness for a particular purpose&quot; applies if you tell the
seller what you intend to use the product for, even if an unexpected
use, and the seller says it will do that. If the seller says the
product will &quot;fit&quot; your purpose, then they are warrantying
the product for that purpose.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Implied

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>If

and take it home, it likely won't fuse hydrogen atoms. But at least,
if you have no shame, you can come back the next day and get your

couldn't kick any of its tires before you buy it. But most people
don't bat an eye at spending $200 on one CD containing an &quot;As

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Part
of the problem is that there is no &quot;As Is&quot; sticker on the
box. If you ever go to an electronics super store, you'll see
stereos, TV's, VCR's, DVD players, and Software for sale. Usually,
when a TV is being sold &quot;As Is&quot;, it's put in a corner
somewhere with a big, ugly &quot;As Is&quot; sticker on it. Every CD
of software, however, is sold &quot;As Is&quot;, in the main aisles
of the store. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The
reason you don't see big, ugly, &quot;As Is&quot; signs is because
software vendors don't want big, ugly &quot;As Is&quot; signs on
their shiny, flashy, multi-color packaging. Customers might actually
realize what they're purchasing comes with no warranty. Vendors
especially don't wont big, ugly &quot;As Is&quot; signs hanging above
their software when they have a three digit price tag on the front.

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Is
your software available to the Public in source code form? Are you
speaking something to the community of programmers in a way that they

that comes in the form of a mass of computer hieroglyphs with no
Rosetta stone? Did you write the program in high level language for
source code, but then did you obfuscate that source code from the
Public? </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>You
cannot obfuscate Free Speech. Obfuscated executables for sale fall
within the realm of Commerce, not Free Speech. If you're giving
source code, readable text, away for free, then Free Speech applies.
Even if you're selling source code, Free Speech applies, the same as
it applies newspapers, magazines, editorials, fiction, and the like
for sale. Source code is text written by humans, and therefore can be
read by humans. And anything written by a person qualifies for Free

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>A
lot of your day to day purchase transactions are simply a sale of
goods, which does not require a contract. You usually don't sign a

When you purchase some widget at a store, you simply buy it free and
clear. There is no agreement between you and the
seller/manufacturer/vendor regarding the widget. You can do whatever
you wish to do with the widget. The only restriction on how you use
the widget would be a matter of criminal and civil law. In other
words, when you buy a hammer at the store, the store doesn't have you
sign a contract saying you agree to use the hammer only for legal

it would be wise to get a written contract when buying or selling a
very expensive item, such that buyer and seller know exactly to what
they are agreeing. When you plan on paying millions of dollars cash
for a piece of real estate, for example, you'd want it all in writing
before you hand over the briefcase full of dough. Likewise, when you
purchase some rare antique for several thousand samollions, you may
wish to put that in writing as well.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>However,
if you walk into a store to buy some mass-produced consumer product,
a contract should be a RED FLAG that the normal laws of product
sales, warranty, and intellectual property, may not apply to the
thing you are about to purchase. The vendor may be attempting to
circumvent product warranty laws. They may be attempting to restrict
your right to Fair Use of the product. They may push the balance of
IP rights versus Public Good far to their favor. And if they sneak
the contract into the packaging for you to discover when you get home

Wrap Contract&quot;, which I discuss later.</FONT></P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Employee Agreement"></A><A HREF="#Part 2">Employee
Agreement</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Open
Source can run into troubles with regard to contracts when it relates
to employee agreements. Generally, employees sign an employee
contract that, among other things, assigns all rights of copyrights
and patents from the employee to the employer. The question then
arises if the employee goes home at night and writes code for an Open
Source project, does the employer then have any rights on that code?</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Well,
it depends on the wording of the employee contract. Does it say
something to the effect of &quot;all works created by the employee&quot;?
Or does it say something more reasonable, such as &quot;all works
made directly as an outcome of the employees assignments&quot;?
Before you start writing code for an Open Source project, you'll want
to check to see if your employer will stake any claims on your
software. If your employer claims copyright on all works created by
you while employed, then you can't give away anything you write to an
Open Source project, because its not yours to give.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Depending
on the wording of your Employee Contract, you may wish to get your
employer to sign a waiver. This would be an agreement between you and
your employer that states that your employer waives all rights with
regard to whatever Open Source project you're working on. You'll need
to be a little more specific than that though. Unfortunately, it's
impossible to make a &quot;one size fits all&quot; style waiver. And
you'll want to be a unambigous as possible. What you don't want is
something that sounds good when your employer signs the waiver, but
could be interpreted in a negative way when your employer wants
rights to your code.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>When
you change jobs, be sure to have your employer sign a waiver that
states they make no claims on anything you've written to date. This
could be especially contentious if you take some old code to you new
job and fix a bug. Your employer may attempt to claim rights to any
modifications you've made since you've started working for them. The
best thing to do is to make it clear that they make no claims on any
program you've written to date (list the programs), as well as any
derivations of that work that you create in the future.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Because
of all the variables involved, because employee agreements are all
different, and because everyone's situation is a little different,
you really need to see a lawyer regarding any waiver between you and
your employer.</FONT></P>

versus Contract</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>A
copyright license and a contract are two different distinctions.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Copyright
law only grants the author control over copying, distributing, and
creating derived works of the original work. A license can only
surrender these rights. A license can be very particular about the
circumstances under which the rights are surrendered, but only the
right to copy, distribute, and modify is within the realm of
copyright law and a license. A license is a declaration by the author
stating which rights are being surrendered. The author is not
agreeing with someone that the author will surrender certain rights.
The author is simply declaring what rights have been surrendered.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>A
license cannot take rights away from the user. A license cannot state
how someone can use the work. A person with a legitimate copy of a
work may use that work any way they wish. If the author wishes to
control how a person uses their software, the author and the user
would have to enter an agreement, a contract, that defines what usage
is and is not allowed. If it doesn't relate to copy, distribute, or
modify, it's outside the rights granted the author under copyright
law. If the author wishes to control something outside the realm of
copyright law, it will have to be achieved via a contract.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>An
author and user may agree to a contract where the user gets to use
the author's software for a certain fee for a duration of one year,
after which, the user agrees to stop using the software. Copyright
law does not grant the author the right to revoke a user's right to
use the software, therefore this arrangement would HAVE to be
achieved through a contract. For example, the specific expectations
of video rentals, which allow a person to view a movie for a limited
amount of time, usually get spelled out in the membership agreement
that you sign when you first get your get your rental card (you know,
that card buried somewhere in you wallet that your can never find
when you get to the checkout counter at the rental store.)</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>A
contract generally specifies certain actions and a schedule for those
actions. Two parties agree on the actions and the schedules, and then
they enter the contract. A video rental store might enter into a
contract with a customer and call it a Rental Agreement. The store
agrees to rent videos to the customer for a limited period of time,
and then the customer agrees to return the video. A software vendor
might enter into a contract with a customer and sell them usage of
their software for a year, with restrictions on the number of
concurrent users, a non-disclosure agreement, and other restrictions.
After the year is up, the customer agrees to stop using the software.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Contracts
can expire. Licenses are irrevocable.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Contracts
may have conditions that must be met or the customer may be
penalized. When the customer signs the contract, they might agree
that if they break certain terms then they agree to pay the seller a
fee, or they agree that they lose the right to use the software, etc.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Licenses
are unconditional. Once you as the author surrender a right to
another individual, you cannot revoke that right and take back that
person's copy of your work. Say you write some software and you wish
to Give it to the world. You license it such that anyone may freely
copy, distribute, and derive the software. You put the software on
the internet somewhere, along with the license. People find your code
and download it. Some time later, you decide to change the license to
say &quot;All Rights Reserved&quot; so that you can better sell the
software. You can apply &quot;All Rights Reserved&quot; to the
software that you post on your website. But you can't take the rights
from the people who have already downloaded your work.</FONT></P>

Alice writes a work and licenses it &quot;All Rights Reserved&quot;.
The work is placed on a website, and large numbers of people download

Fair Use of Alice's work. People can still make copies of the work
for personal use. But they cannot re-distribute it, re-write it, or
cut and paste Alice's work into their own work. Alice can make the
work available for free on the internet or she may charge to download
it or she may stuff her work full of advertisements that pay her for

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>No
previously granted rights are being revoked. Rather, new rights are
being granted by the author. Therefore, there is no conflict in this
second form of relicensing.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Relicensing
comes up once in a while in Open Source projects. It's usually not a
matter of going from &quot;Anyone may freely copy, distribute, and
modify&quot; to &quot;All Rights Reserved&quot;. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually,
its a matter of the author wanting to go from the GNU General Public
License and relicense to the MIT license, or something like that.
There are roughly two dozen licenses that are approved by the Open
Source Initiative. However, because some licenses grant more rights
and some license grant less rights, relicensing has its concerns.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>First
and foremost, relicensing cannot revoke the rights granted to the
previous work or revoke previous customers of their rights to your
work. You can relicense a work in a more restrictive way from this
point forward, but all previously distributed copies and recipients
retain the rights with which they received the work.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Another
consideration of relicensing is a matter of whether or not you are
the sole author or not. All authors of a work must agree to changing
the terms of the license. If you are writing Open Source software,
and you cut and pasted someone else's patch into your code, you are
no longer the sole author. Say Author Alice writes a program and
distributes it &quot;anyone may copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this work&quot;. Patchwork Pete get's Alice's code, finds a huge
bug, fixes it for his copy, and sends the patch back to Alice. (note:
Fair Use allows Pete to modify his personal version of the code, even
though Alice's license does not grant the right to derive.) If Alice
takes Pete's patch and paste's it into her code, then Alice and Pete
are now authors of the work.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>If
Alice wants to relicense the modified work &quot;All Rights Reserved&quot;
and sell copies of it, she must get Pete's approval.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Contrarwise,
Alice could see that Pete's patch may fix the bug, but leaves the
code in nightmarish form. Alice could instead choose to implement
Pete's functionality without using Pete's artistic expression,
nightmarish code, and have the other advantage of not making Pete her
co-author. In this case, Alice could then relicense the work without
Pete's input. Of course, this doesn't prevent Pete from filing a
lawsuit for copyright infringement and settling out of court for an
undisclosed amount. So, Alice might be better served to post a notice
that requests all patches and bug fixes be accompanied by a statement
by their author that assigns all rights of Copyright to Alice. This
alleviates any confusion in the matter.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Alice's
other option is to simply refuse all patches, bug fixes, and similar
input from outside sources. She might include a statement in her
distribution that says she accepts bug reports, but won't view bug
fixes. She would therefore remain the work's sole author and can
relicense it as she saw fit.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>In
summary, relicensing has two main restrictions:</FONT></P>
<OL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The

their version, creating a Copyright Fork. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">This would be the kind of
thing that would happen if I took a Public Domain work, such as
Hamlet, and created my own derived version of the work, in the form
of a movie starring Eddie Murphy as the leading man. My version of
Hamlet would be a copyrighted work. No one would be allowed to copy,
modify, or derive my work unless I licensed them permission to do so.
However, the original Hamlet would still be Public Domain, and
therefore, anyone could derive their own version of Hamlet as they
saw fit.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">A Copyleft license is more
restrictive than a Public license. Copyleft disallows Copyright Forks
by following this basic template: 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; text-indent: 0.49in">&quot;&lt;License
Name&gt;::: Anyone may copy, distribute, and create derived works of
the original work as long as the work being distributed is licensed
under the terms of &lt;License Name&gt;.&quot; 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">Note that this is not a
contract, and that this is within the realm of a valid license. The
author using a copyleft license is granting the right to derive the
work in the specific case where any distributed work will be licensed
the same as the original. This is not a contract taking place over
time, nor is it a grant of rights with a revocation trigger. It is
simply a very specific, very explicity, and very narrow grant of the
right to copy, distribute, and derive the original work.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">The GNU General Public
License is the first license to use the idea of Copyleft. According
to the GPL Preamble, the reasoning behind Copyleft is this:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; text-indent: 0.49in">&quot;To
protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">This view is NOT in
alignment with the way copyright law works. Once a work is made
Public, no one can deny you or require you to surrender those rights
to the work. If Author Alice were to write &quot;Hamlet&quot; and
give it a truly Public license, no one would be able to remove
&quot;Hamlet&quot; from the Public. Proprietary Pete could come along
and create a derived version of Hamlet that has a proprietary license
&quot;All Rights Reserved&quot;. But Pete's version does not prevent
Bob from creating a work derived from Alices that has the same
functionality as Pete's versions. The only requirement is that Bob
cannot cut and paste Pete's code.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">Copyleft makes it
impossible to create proprietary versions of the original code. This
is within the author's rights to do so, however, from an energy point
of view, it prevents the momentum introduced into the Gift Exchange
community from flowing into Commodity Exchange channels. From an
energy point of view, Gift Exchange and Commodity Exchange both
conserve energy. Copyright law prevents the Public work from being
&quot;stolen&quot; from the Gift Community. An individual or a group
operating in a Commodity Exchange are prevented by Copyright law from
removing the Gift from the Public body of works. They can sell the
software to the Public, but this does not prohibit anyone else from
giving functionally equivalent software to the Public. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>From a Gift Exchange point of view, the concept of
Copyleft does not ring like a true gift. A true gift is given freely
to the reciever, with no restrictions, or obligations. A true Gift
Exchange prohibits the giver from giving the gift as a means to
dominate the receiver or to leave the reciever with a sense of
indebtedness. A true gift can NOT be given to humiliate or to
establish or reinforce hierarchies.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">When the gift is given as a
means to exert control or influence on the reciever (or the community
as a whole), or when it is given out of a feeling of obligation, then
all community-building benefits that come with a Gift Exchange are
destroyed. Such a transaction should not be considered a Gift
Exchange.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">Copyleft narrows the
definition of Community to only those trafficking in the Gift
Exchange mode, and it specifically excludes anyone trafficking in a
Commodity Exchange. This attitude has created an intensly bonded
community of programmers that license their code under the GNU GPL,
however, it needlessly alienates any and all individuals who operate
in the Commodity Exchange. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">To what end, I'm not sure.
Perhaps it is a programmer's way of &quot;Homesteading&quot; his
program in the &quot;Noosphere&quot;, and preventing anyone from
coming in and making a functionaly equivalent, but proprietary,
program. This could reflect the programmer's Fear of a professional
group coming in to the same &quot;Noosphere&quot; and making a better
program. Or it could reflect the programmer's attempt to Punish
proprietary approaches that have abused the legal system and use
monopolistic, market domination techniques. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">Many proprietary vendors
operate within the field of Commodity Exchange as it pertains to a
fair balance of energy being transferred from buyer to seller. I have
worked for a number of companies that sell their wares under the
banner of &quot;All Rights Reserved&quot;, and I have had no qualms
about working within a proprietary Commodity Exchange to pay my
bills. Most of my employers sold something of value on the
marketplace. If they didn't, I'd move on. Copyleft prevents companies
that traffic in Fair Trade from adding value to Open Source software
in a Commodity Exchange. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">Some would argue that
companies can make money without resorting to Proprietary licenses.
But that is not my point. A Commodity Exchange and Gift Exchange both
model a conservation of energy. A Commodity Exchange could involve a
company such as Red Hat, which sells support for an Open Source
operating system. Or a Commodity Exchange could involve a company
such as Pete's Proprietary Inc., which writes software on top of an
Open Source code base, and sells that software &quot;All Rights
Reserved&quot;. One form of exchange is not &quot;better&quot; than
the other. Both exchanges are modeled after a conservation of energy,
and both models serve the Public Good in their own way.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">My point is that keeping a
Gift Exchange alive is about allowing the gift to flow through the
community. The point is NOT about locking proprietary vendors out of
the community without cause.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">I will admit that there IS
sufficient evidence that the Open Source community should be wary of
certain proprietary vendors. I talk about the &quot;Halloween
Documents&quot; from Microsoft Corporation a bit later. But I believe
there are ways and means that an Open Source project can license
their work Publicly, protect their Gift Community from the likes of
Microsoft Corporation, and NOT have to resort to Copyleft approaches.
The goal is to license works as Publicly as possible.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">I'll explore this in more
detail in Part 3.</P>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Dual Licensing"></A><A HREF="#Part 2">Dual
Licensing</A></H1>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">An Open Source project will
often combine software from different sources, different authors, and
different licenses. When this happens, the most restrictive license
used in the project becomes the limit to how close to the Public
Domain the project can get. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">The Gnu's Not Unix General
Public License (GNU GPL) is one of the most commonly used Open Source
licenses. It is also one of the least Public licenses approved by the
Open Source Initiative (not necessarily THE most restictive, but it
takes a good shot at it). The GNU GPL is a Copyleft license and
therefore requires that all derived works must be GNU GPL compatible
as well. Because <A HREF="#Copyright Linking is Deriving">linking is
deriving</A>, this means that any worked distributed as a linked
executable with GNU GPL code must be GNU GPL'ed itself. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">The only way to get around
the <A HREF="#Copyright Linking is Deriving">linking is deriving</A>
legal technicality is to distribute the individual components as an
&quot;aggregation&quot; and include a makefile that the user runs. An
&quot;aggregation&quot; is a collection of works that are unlinked,
and therefore, license independent from each other. A makefile is a
script that the user runs which performs the linking operation and
creates a standalone executable. Why does this get around the <A HREF="#Copyright Linking is Deriving">linking
is deriving</A> technicality? Because the GNU GPL allows anyone to
link GPL software with proprietary software (i.e. Create a derived
work) as long as that person does not distribute the combined work.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">Not all Open Source
projects have this viral restriction placed on derived works.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">One example is the Perl
project. Perl is a programming language that is sometimes referred to
as &quot;The Glue That Holds The Internet Together&quot;. It is a
very powerful language, and it is very easy to use (barring a few
linguistic abnormalities). In short, perl is a very successful Open
Source project. And perl is licensed under the Perl Artistic License,
which does not have the viral characteristics of Copyleft. In fact,
the Perl Artistic License puts the work very near the Public Domain,
with the exception being that any derived work must be named
differently than, and include pointers to, the original work. (It's a
little more complicated than that, really, but that's the short
version.)</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">The issue is that the Perl
Artistic License is closer to the Public Domain than the GNU General
Public License. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">Or, to put it another way,
the more restrictive GNU General Public License will not allow the
very public Perl Artistic License to be so public,not so long as Perl
wants to play with anything GNU GPL'ed.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">And when licenses are
combined (linked and therefore &quot;derived&quot;), the most
restrictive license forces its limits on all other code.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">To get around this, Perl
has to allow a more restrictive licensing option so that it would be
compatible with GNU GPL. Perl is available under a &quot;Dual
License&quot;. You can either use Perl under the Perl Artistic
License, or you can use Perl under the GNU GPL. If you don't need to
play with anything under the GNU GPL, you can use the Perl Artistic
License and consider Perl to be one step from Public Domain.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">Because GNU GPL is one of
the more common Open Source licenses, and because GNU GPL is usually
the least public license when compared with other Open Source
licenses, you will commonly find many Open Source projects and
packages available under Dual Licensing schemes, a Public Domain
style license, and a more restrictive GNU GPL license so that the
software can be compiled and built with other GNU GPL code.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.49in">Dual Licensing, the short
review: A work may be licensed in such a way to make it very near a
Public Domain work. This license may be too public for other open
source projects which have more restrictive licenses. When combining
/ linking / deriving works together that have different licenses, the
most restrictive license limits how Public all other works can be.
For a work licensed near the Public Domain to be compatible with more
restrictive licenses, the author(s) may choose to allow multiple
licensing schemes, one being the license near Public Domain, and the
other being more restrictive to match the restrictions of other
licenses. When an author offers a work under multiple licenses, this
is called Dual Licensing.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">UCITA takes everything that
has gone bad with intellectual property law and makes it official. It
blesses the use of Shrink Wrap Contracts that disclaim any reasonable
expectation of a warranty and allows them to be hidden neatly away
inside the packaging, out of view from the consumer's prying eyes.
Those ugly &quot;As Is&quot; stickers are conveniently avoided. UCITA
blesses the use of Shrink Wrap Contracts that prevent
reverse-engineering of a product and Free Speech about that product.
UCITA would allow vendors to prevent consumer groups from providing
independent reviews of their products. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">The rights gifted by the
Public to authors and inventors is simply insufficient in the eyes of
UCITA. By blessing the use of Shrink Wrap Contracts, companies can
sell a product to the Public and bundle it with a contract containing
a Wish List of rights. Some Shrink Wrap Contracts go so far as to
make Copyright claims on any work the customer produces while using
the seller's product. Imagine buying a camera that says &quot;We
claim copyrights on all pictures you take with our camera, just in
case you take any valuable pictures with our camera.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Those supporting UCITA
claim that software is simply too complex to offer any kind of
warranty. Applying this argument to any complex, real-world object,
the complexity of automobiles would excuse auto makers from
guaranteeing their work. This is not exactly the expectation that
people have when they buy a new car. Satellite TV is a somewhat
complex operation, if you consider rocket-science, radiation hardened
equipment, and fail-safe, self-healing designs to be complex, but you
do not expect your satelite TV service to fail regularly. The
telephone system is pretty complex when you consider all the
functionality, switching capability, and reliability behind your
phone service. When an ice-storm hits, I'll expect to lose my power
long before I lose my phone. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="text-indent: 0.51in">Warranty laws apply in
every state, for every product, with the exception of software. And
this has, so far, produced commercial software packages that fail so
frequently that failure is expected. People save their files on a
minute by minute basis. Backups are performed nightly and taken
offline so a bad piece of software doesn't erase them. The &quot;Blue
Screen Of Death&quot; is a frequent visitor. UCITA will simply allow
vendors to take &quot;Quality&quot; as any form of a product
requirement and flush it down the toilet as an expensive
inconvenience.

having a monopoly to manufacture the product and being able to sell
it at a comfortably high profit margin, a commodity product is
manufactured by many competitors. Successful sales of a commodity
product relies on high quality and low price, since anyone can build
the product. Competition in a Fair market will encourage
manufacturers to create good products for a low price for consumers.
The best manufacturers make a profit and stay in business, and the
customers get something of value for their money spent.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>A mousetrap or
a hammer would be a commodity, since anyone can manufacture and sell
them. The company that can sell the best mousetrap or hammer at the
lowest price will be rewarded.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Many computer
and internet standards can be considered commodities. The standard
defines the functionality of some interface and is made Public. Since
anyone can manufacture products that follow the standard, the
commodity is subject to Fair market pressures. Open standards that
everyone agrees upon rewards the manufacture with the best product at
the lowest price, and the consumers win in the end.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>A commodity
protocol would be any Public, open protocol that is considered a
standard.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Microsoft's
response to successful Open Source projects is to &quot;<I>De-commoditize
protocols &amp; applications</I>&quot;. This means that Microsoft
intends to modify standard Public protocols to create
incompatibilities. By making their products incompatible with the
Public standard, Microsoft hopes to avoid selling their software on a
commodity market where good quality at a low price is rewarded and
all other manufacturers lose out. Microsoft can attempt to sell their
product at an advantage (skillset advantage and price advantage), and
the Public loses out in the end.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>This form of
attack is sometimes given as evidence to support the argument for
Copyleft in Open Source projects. Since Copyleft forces all derived
works to be licensed the same as the original, it is impossible for
any attempt to change the standard to be kept proprietary. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>However, this
argument assumes the premise that the attack is a real threat to Open
Source projects. What Microsoft is proposing is a Copyright Fork,
which, from the point of view of a energy transfer, takes nothing
from the Gift Exchange community. Furthermore, many Open Source
success stories revolve around some complex, non-standard protocol
being implemented and made available in an Open Source project. It
also assumes that users are not smart enough to realize that
decommoditizing a protocol is not something done for their benefit.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Open Source
projects can protect themselves against the de-commoditization of
standard protocols and applications without resorting to Copyleft. If
the Open Source code is implementing a standard, the license can
allow any derived works which follow the standard. Furthermore, an
exclusion on any derived work which involves patented methods will
prevent decommoditizing protocols from resorting to patents.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>The Halloween
Documents show that Microsoft has properly assessed the key element
of successful Open Source projects:</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3><I>Binaries
may die but source code lives forever.</I></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>However, their
conclusion to attack Open Source shows that they have failed to heed
their own assessment. No amount of Code Forking can remove the Open
Source source code from the Public. No amount of incompatible
binaries will affect the source code already given to the Public. </FONT>
