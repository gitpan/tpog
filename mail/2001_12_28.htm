<!-- body -->
<pre><hr size=1>TPOG reminds me of the curate's egg: good in parts.  It contains flaws 
which make me wonder about the validity of its conclusions (not that 
the conclusions are necessarily incorrect but that their derivation 
cannot be validated). 
 
For starters you seem to have fallen prey to Marxist belief that value 
is conserved in a commodity transaction.  You allow for a slight 
discrepancy between buyers' and sellers' markets without pondering the 
consequences of that.  You are not alone in that because the use of 
money in transactions obscures facts a little. 
 
Consider a barter between a sheep farmer and a pig farmer whereby they 
exchange a pig and a sheep of roughly equal meat content and which 
took roughly equal amounts of labour to rear.  According to you this 
is an exchange of roughly equal value.	Now consider that the sheep 
farmer has tried raising pigs but doesn't have the knack of it: he 
could raise 10 sheep with the amount of labour that it takes him to 
raise one pig.	Also, since he eats mutton and lamb every day the sheep 
farmer is more than a little bored with sheep and craves the taste of 
pork which to him is of much greater value because it is a welcome 
change and because it would cost him 10 times as much effort to raise. 
The pig farmer is in the mirror position. 
 
So, far from exchanging goods of approximately equal value, each has 
gained immensely by the transaction.  Each has obtained something he 
prizes in exchange for something that to him is of little value.  Each 
has profited thereby.  The profit may be notional, but if each were to 
raise the animal he has difficulty with rather than exchange with each 
other the cost of those animals would have been far greater.  In this 
case, each has expended far less labour to obtain the animal. 
 
The use of money obscures this fact a little.  However, for any item you 
can name you will find some people who think that the monetary price 
is a bargain and willing to pay much more; you will also find some 
people who think that the monetary price is excessive and would not 
purchase unless it were half the price.  The monetary price of any 
item reflects not just its cost of manufacture, distribution and a 
profit margin but also what people are willing to pay.	Retailers find 
that the elasticity of demand allows them to pick a price that 
maximizes return.  Too low means more sales but these are more than 
offset by lower profit.  Too high means greater profit but this is 
more than offset by reduced sales.  Any monetary value attached to an 
item is at best an approximation to some statistical mean. 
 
To consider another aspect.  Apples, flour and sugar each have a 
specific subjective value to a person.	Each person has a different 
subjective value which determines whether or not the objective value 
asked for those items is one he is prepared to pay.  A good cook may 
purchase those items and turn them into an apple pie whose value many 
people will deem far higher than the cost of the raw goods and the 
labour involved simply because his apple pie is far better than those 
made by anyone else.  In contrast a bad cook can take those 
ingredients and turn them into an apple pie that is inedible garbage 
that nobody would pay for. 
 
The idea that value (or &quot;energy&quot; as you call it) is conserved is 
false.	It is not an objective metric in the first place (what you 
treasure I deem trash) and it can be both created (by a good cook) or 
destroyed (by a bad one).  Any analysis that starts with the 
presumption that value is an objective metric which is conserved is 
fundamentally flawed.  Marxism started out with that premise and the 
result was economic collapse of a large empire. 
 
The next problem is with the history of IP rights.  Historically, 
trade secrets were all there were and they were not granted by 
governments but coined by the simple process of finding a new way of 
doing things and keeping it secret.  Naturally this applied more 
frequently to the processes of manufacturing something than the item 
itself.  It is difficult to conceal what a bicycle looks like but it 
may be possible to conceal the process by which the steel is drawn 
into tubes suitable for making the frame. 
 
Historically, patents were introduced to *entice* those who 
successfully kept secret their trade secrets into revealing them with 
a promise of a limited period of protection.  It offered them a 
gamble.  They could keep the trade secret and hope that nobody else 
figured out how they did it (a risk because what one man can think of 
so can another) or they could reveal the secret in return for guaranteed 
protection for a number of years.  It was never the intention to make 
them a gift, as you claim, since those who had successfully kept trade 
secrets for a long time and could reasonably expect to keep them for 
much longer still had no need for a &quot;gift&quot; such as that.  It was an 
offer to gamble.  Whether or not a person chose to gamble depended on 
his assessment of the risks and the payoffs.  A subjective value 
decision. 
 
It is debatable if the grant of a patent fits your own definition of a 
gift exchange.	The purpose of creating a system of patents was indeed 
for public benefit since it was hoped that by releasing a trade secret 
which one person might never take any further that others would be 
able to expand upon it and create new techniques and inventions that 
they would not have thought of had the original secret not been revealed. 
But the reason a particular individual would decide to apply for a  
patent rather than keep something a trade secret is not to benefit the 
public but to maximize revenue from that technique or invention. 
 
It is also my recollection (which I have not checked) that the penalty 
for revealing a trade secret applies ONLY to those who gained 
knowledge of that trade secret DIRECTLY from the holder of that 
secret.  I.e., an employee may not reveal his employer's trade secrets 
and there are penalties for doing so.  Should somebody else stumble 
across the idea independently and tell the world about it, that is 
without penalty.  If you have seen court decisions which say otherwise 
then it is my understanding that they are wrong. 
 
Finally, and this is unpardonable, your strong belief that contracts 
should apply only to items which are leased for a period of time and that 
outright purchases should not have a contract.	It is true that many 
purchases have no need of a WRITTEN contract.  However, the ESSENCE of 
contract law is that there is a &quot;mutual exchange of considerations.&quot; 
The exchange of money for goods IS a contract between two parties even 
if there is no accompanying paperwork.	It transfers the right of 
ownership in exchange for money, for a deed or for any other consideration. 
Contract law is quite clear that there must be a mutual exchange of 
considerations for contract law to apply.  Contract law does not apply to 
gifts or to promises because those are unilateral. 
 
Any exchange of goods for money (or other considerations) may have written 
terms and conditions which both parties must agree to.	This is not 
something that is designed to treat one party unfairly (although it 
may be abused that way) but a simple fact of law.  In US jurisdiction  
in particular, contractual terms may be stricken by a court unless they are  
equitable to both parties (UK law is less particular about this and is	
concerned primarily with whether or not both parties understood the terms to 
mean the same things and were fully cognizant of their implications). 
A properly-drawn contract PROTECTS people from the other party to the 
contract defaulting in some way on that which they should have 
delivered.
