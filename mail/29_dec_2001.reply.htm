Everyone in a commodity exchange enters a transaction for their
own personal profit, gain, advantage.

In your scenario, my concept of "energy being conserved" is absent
because you did not mention a free market, an availability of buyers and
sellers of sheep and pigs. If such a market existed, and if your
premise that pigs and sheep are of approximately equal meat and
approximately equal labor to raise them, then a free market would
find that hogs and sheep are being bought and sold at approximately
the same price.

Therefore, your barter between pig and sheep farmer conserves energy.

The tpog document could use some clarification in distinguishing
the individuals from the transaction itself.

What I'm calling energy is objectively measurable as "price on a free market".
I'm not concerned with the individual preferences of someone likes to eat
mutton and someone else prefers bacon. I'm concerned with the transaction
between individuals, not the individuals themselves. In the realm of a 
Free Market, such a transaction will tend to balance.The individuals may
profit or gain by their part in the transaction, but the transaction as
a whole, from the perspective of the marketplace, is one that tends towards
being balanced.

I'm not sure what your specifically disagreeing with here.
I agree with this paragraph.

Trade Secrets still exist. And for situations where a business
believes they can apply them, they would do so.

However, I'll disagree with:
"those who had successfully kept trade secrets for a long time and 
 could reasonably expect to keep them for much longer still 
 had no need for a "gift" such as that"

A Trade Secret would be impossible to apply to a Publicly available 
consumer item, such as your bicycle.

If the idea is for company internal use only, then they would
be wise to use Trade Secrets. However, if a company wishes to
design a better mousetrap and sell it to the world,then the only
way to protect their invention is via a Patent.
Same goes for a writer who wishes to sell copies of his book
on the open market.Once someone buys a single copy, Trade Secret
law would be insufficient to protect the author.

The Public did not need Patent and Copyright laws.
The manufacturers and authors needed them.

It is an enticement, yes. But it was an enticement offered
by the Public not because the Public needed it, but because
the Public felt that Patents and Copyright could serve the
Public Good.

Yes. And your assessment is focused solely on the profit motive,
the selfishness, of the individual. Your pig/sheep barter analogy 
above does the same. 

Individuals may act for selfish reasons, 
but that is only half of the transaction.

The Public is the other half of that transaction. And the Public
allowed the individual the rights of patent/copyright protection
because it would serve the Public Good.

The natural state of ideas is that they are free and only secrets
have protection. Patent and copyrights grant protection to inventions
and writings made Public.

In tpog.html, section "Trade Secrets", paragraph 4, I say:

"Someone operating in Trade Secret law decides to forgo any protections 
 available under patent law. Instead, they choose to maintain a monopoly 
 for as long as no one else can independently create the secret. Once 
 someone else independently discovers the knowledge of the secret, the 
 Trade Secret holder loses any control over the Secret."

So, I believe we are in agreement on this point.

The tpog document uses poor wording, "Contracts", paragraph 5:

"In short, contracts are used when you pay for something over time 
 (loans) or when you agree to buy/sell service for a period of time 
 (your job, your cell phone service)."

Saying contracts "are used" did not intend to mean they "are ONLY used".

However, the wording could be much more clear.I'll attempt to fix
the document and re-release it soon.

You might enter a contract to purchase something expensive and important,
etc,and it might not involve a duration of time. You might own the 
item free and clear, and the contract is used to simply explicitely
state all terms of the transaction.

The focus of the document, however, is to point out that most sales of 
goods are simple transactions without a contract. When you buy a bicycle, 
you usually don't enter into a contract, you simply pay your money and
take the bike.

This in contrast to software sales where you pay your money, take
the software, and open it at home to find you've entered into a 
contract after teh fact.

I believe that software should be treated as any other product for
point of sales transactions. If you buy the product free and clear,
you should not enter into a contract to do so. 

Most software contracts go above and beyond copyright and patent
protection and attempt to apply Trade Secret levels of protection
to a device available for Public sale.

I believe that shrink wrap contracts trivialize the intent of 
aggreement before entering a contract, and trivialize contracts
as a whole. And I believe that contracts should not be entered into
for every purchase, for every transaction under the sun.

Nor do I believe that contracts should be allowed for mass consumer
products available for purchase to the wide Public, and used in such
a way as to remove the benefits to the Public Good that were create 
by Patent and Copyright law.

Patent and Copyright law were created with a balance in mind,
balancing the individual inventor's incentive with the Public Good.

Shrink wrap contracts throw this out the window.
